## Overview

The IPAM module is the core of SpatiumDDI. It manages the hierarchy of IP space from broad routing domains down to individual IP addresses. All other modules (DHCP, DNS) reference IPAM resources.

---

## 1. IP Hierarchy

<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/diagrams/ipam-containment.svg" alt="IP hierarchy — containment model" width="900"/>
</p>

### IP Space
- Represents a **VRF** or isolated routing domain (e.g., "Corporate", "Internet", "OOB")
- IPs in different spaces may overlap without conflict
- One space can be marked `is_default` for simplified deployments

### IP Block
- Aggregate/supernet range (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`)
- Used for **organizational grouping** — you cannot directly assign IPs to a block
- Blocks can be **nested** (a /16 block inside a /8 block)
- Sub-blocks and subnets are children in the tree

### Subnet
- The primary unit of management — a routable network with a gateway
- IPs are allocated, tracked, and assigned at the subnet level
- Subnets cannot overlap within the same IP Space
- Subnets in *different* IP Spaces **may** overlap (VRF semantics) — but overlapping spaces must use **disjoint DHCP and DNS server groups**: one Kea server cannot serve two same-prefix subnets, and one DNS group cannot hold two same-name reverse zones. Enforced per #844 (scope create/activate `409`; reverse-zone attach refused)

---

## 2. IP Block & Subnet Tree UI

Both IP blocks and subnets are displayed in a **tree view** in the UI, mirroring the network hierarchy.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/diagrams/ipam-example-tree.svg" alt="IPAM tree — worked example" width="900"/>
</p>

### Tree Features
- Expand/collapse nodes
- Utilization color-coded bars (green < 70%, amber 70–90%, red > 90%)
- Right-click context menu: Create child block, Create subnet, Edit, Delete
- Drag nodes to reorganize (with validation — child must fit inside parent CIDR)
- Free space visualization: show unallocated ranges within a block

## 3. Subnet Model (Extended)

```
Subnet
  id, space_id, block_id (nullable)
  network: cidr              -- e.g., 10.1.2.0/24
  name, description
  
  -- Layer 2 / Switching
  vlan_id: int (nullable)    -- 802.1Q VLAN tag (1–4094)
  vxlan_id: int (nullable)   -- VXLAN VNI (1–16777215)
  
  -- Routing Context
  gateway: inet (nullable)
  router_zone_id (FK → RouterZone, nullable)  -- see section 4
  
  -- DNS Integration

## 4. VLAN / VXLAN and Router Zones

Subnets can be associated with Layer 2 and routing context.

### VLAN / VXLAN Assignment

- `vlan_id`: 802.1Q VLAN tag. Informational in IPAM (SpatiumDDI does not configure switches directly).
- `vxlan_id`: VXLAN VNI. Used in overlay network environments.
- Both can be set simultaneously (e.g., VLAN 100 mapped to VNI 10100).
- A lookup table `VLANMapping` tracks VLAN → VXLAN mappings for reference.

### Router Zone / Domain

A **RouterZone** groups subnets that are locally significant to a routing domain or site:

```
RouterZone
  id, name, description
  type: enum(site, vrf_lite, mpls_domain, data_center, custom)
  parent_zone_id (nullable)   -- zones can be nested (campus → building → floor)
  contact_info: str           -- who manages routing in this zone
  notes: str
```

Subnets assigned to the same RouterZone imply they share routing context (e.g., all subnets on a campus router). This is informational in Phase 1 but can drive automation in later phases (pushing route configs to routers via API).

---

## 5. IP Address Model (Extended)

```
IPAddress
  id, subnet_id
  address: inet
  status: enum(
    available,      -- not assigned, not seen
    allocated,      -- manually assigned in IPAM
    reserved,       -- held but not assigned (e.g., future use, gateway placeholder)
    dhcp,           -- currently active DHCP lease
    static_dhcp,    -- has a static DHCP assignment (requires mac_address)
    discovered,     -- seen on network but not in IPAM
    orphan,         -- was assigned, device no longer seen
    deprecated      -- was assigned, now decommissioned
  )
  hostname: str (nullable)
  fqdn: str (nullable, computed from hostname + domain)
  domain_id (FK → DNSZone, nullable)   -- which domain this hostname belongs to
  mac_address: macaddr (nullable)      -- required when status = static_dhcp
  description: str
  
  -- Ownership
  owner_user_id (FK → User, nullable)
  owner_group_id (FK → Group, nullable)
  managed_by: str (nullable)   -- free text, or pulled from custom fields
  
  -- Linked Records
  dns_record_id (FK → DNSRecord, nullable)
  dhcp_lease_id (FK → DHCPLease, nullable)
  static_assignment_id (FK → DHCPStaticAssignment, nullable)
  
  -- Discovery
  last_seen_at: timestamp (nullable)
  last_seen_method: enum(ping, arp, dhcp, manual, snmp)
  
  -- Custom Fields
  custom_fields: JSONB
  
  tags: JSONB
  created_at, modified_at, created_by_user_id
```

### Next Available IP Allocation

`POST /api/v1/ipam/subnets/{id}/next`

```json
{
  "strategy": "sequential",    // "random", or "eui64" (IPv6)
  "hostname": "app-server-01",
  "description": "New app server",
  "custom_fields": { "ticket": "INC-12345" }
}
```

Returns the allocated IPAddress. Allocation is atomic (uses DB-level `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the subnet row to prevent race conditions). The picker skips network/broadcast placeholders and any IP inside a dynamic DHCP pool.

### Wake-on-LAN (#533)

`POST /api/v1/ipam/addresses/{id}/wake`

Sends a Wake-on-LAN magic packet to the IP's MAC. The MAC comes from the
address row and the IPv4 broadcast target is derived from the IP's subnet, so
the request body only needs an optional `port` (default 9) and an optional
run-from `target`:

```json
{ "port": 9, "target": { "kind": "server" } }
```

- `target.kind = "server"` (default) — the control-plane container broadcasts.
  Only wakes hosts on a segment the api container can reach (the common
  single-box case).
- `target.kind = "appliance"` + `target.id` — dispatch to a Fleet appliance
  whose NIC sits on the target's segment, so the packet originates in the right
  broadcast domain (reuses the generic nettool command channel).

Optionally arm a post-wake liveness check (#596) — the body accepts `verify`
(default `false`), `verify_wait_seconds` (default 60), `verify_retries` (default
1) and `verify_method` (default `auto`). See
[Ad-hoc wake verify](#ad-hoc-wake-verify-596) below.

Gated by the `use_network_tools` permission and audited against the IP
(`action="wake_on_lan"`; the audit row carries `verify_run_id` when verify was
armed). Surfaced as a **Wake** button on the IP detail modal (shown only when the
IP has a MAC), with a **verify** checkbox beside it, and as the
`propose_wake_host` Operator Copilot tool. WoL is IPv4-only — the magic packet
rides a UDP broadcast.

### Scheduled Wake-on-LAN (#586, Phases 1–3)

The one-shot **Wake** button above sends a single magic packet on demand.
**Scheduled Wake-on-LAN** layers a recurring, tag-targeted job on top of the
same #533 send path — the schedule owns *when*, *which hosts*, and *how*; the
actual packet dispatch is the shipped `app.services.wol` code unchanged.

Phase 1 shipped the recurring tag-targeted schedule + built-in holiday/term gate;
Phase 2 layered an external iCal / CalDAV calendar gate; Phase 3 adds **post-wake
liveness verify + bounded retry**, **stagger auto-tuning** for large fleets, and the
**FOG / PXE re-image runbook** below.

Lives behind the `tools.wake_scheduler` feature module, which ships
**disabled** — it ends in magic packets going out on a schedule, so it is
opted into ([#1069](https://github.com/spatiumnorth/spatiumddi/issues/1069)).
Enable it under Settings → Features; while it is off the router prefix,
sidebar entry, and MCP tools all drop out (non-negotiable #14). REST surface is mounted at `/api/v1/wake-scheduler`
(the Python package is `wol_schedules`; the wire prefix is `wake-scheduler`,
the cross-surface contract shared with the frontend and MCP layers). Every
handler is gated by the `wake_scheduler` permission (`read` / `write` /
`delete`) and every mutation is audited (non-negotiables #3, #4). Operator
Copilot gets read tools (`find_wol_schedules`, …) plus a `propose_*` write
that lands in the standard preview → apply flow (non-negotiable #13).

#### Schedules

A `wol_schedule` row carries the recurrence, the target selector, the built-in
holiday gate, and the send knobs:

- `name` / `description` / `enabled`.
- `schedule_cron` — a standard cron expression, or **NULL** for a
  manual-only schedule (never swept by the beat task; fires only via
  **Run now**).
- `timezone` — an IANA zone (e.g. `America/Toronto`). The cron walks the
  operator's **wall clock** in this zone, so a `0 7 * * 1-5` "07:00 on
  weekdays" job stays at 07:00 local across DST transitions rather than
  drifting an hour twice a year.
- `next_run_at` — denormalised UTC, the beat sweep's due-query key. A
  Celery beat task polls for due schedules, re-checks the holiday gate at
  fire time, dispatches, and recomputes `next_run_at` from the cron +
  timezone.

Each fire (scheduled **or** manual) writes a `wol_run` history row — including
gated skips, so "skipped because holiday" stays visible — with per-host
`wol_run_target` children recording `sent` / `skipped` / `failed`, the
resolved MAC and its `mac_source` (`ip` / `history` / `lease`), the segment
broadcast, and the vantage the packet left from. Run history uses
`ON DELETE SET NULL` on the schedule FK so deleting a schedule doesn't erase
the audit trail of what it did.

#### Targeting modes

The `target_selector` JSONB picks the host set at fire time (resolved fresh on
every run, so newly-tagged hosts are picked up automatically). Four modes:

| Mode | Selector shape | Wakes |
|---|---|---|
| `address_tags` | `{ "mode": "address_tags", "tags": ["wake:nightly"] }` | Every IP address carrying **all** the listed tags |
| `subnet_tags` | `{ "mode": "subnet_tags", "tags": ["env:lab"] }` | Every host in every subnet carrying the listed tags |
| `subnet` | `{ "mode": "subnet", "subnet_ids": [<uuid>, …] }` | Every host in the named subnets |
| `hosts` | `{ "mode": "hosts", "address_ids": [<uuid>, …] }` | An explicit list of IP addresses |

Resolution is **permission-scoped to the schedule's creator** (non-negotiable
#3): a schedule can only wake hosts in subnets its owner may `read`, so a
tag-match can't be used to reach across a tenancy boundary. Multicast subnets
and soft-deleted subnets are excluded (they hold no host MACs); addresses with
no resolvable MAC are recorded as a per-host `no_mac` skip rather than
silently dropped. Use **Preview targets** on the schedule modal to see the
resolved host set (and skip reasons) before saving or running.

#### Built-in holiday gate (Phase 1)

Every schedule carries a **built-in** blackout/term gate that needs no external
calendar (the [calendar subscription](#calendar-subscriptions-phase-2) below is
an optional additional gate layered on top):

- `blackout_dates` — a list of ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` dates. A fire whose **local**
  calendar date (evaluated in the schedule's `timezone`) is a member is
  skipped with `skip_reason = "holiday"`.
- `active_from` / `active_until` — an optional term range. A fire whose local
  date falls outside `[active_from, active_until]` is skipped with
  `skip_reason = "off_term"` (e.g. a classroom lab that should only wake
  during the school term).

The gate is evaluated on the local date so a 07:00-local wake on a blackout day
is correctly suppressed regardless of the UTC offset. Skipped runs are still
recorded as `wol_run` rows so the skip is auditable.

#### Calendar subscriptions (Phase 2)

Phase 2 layers an **external calendar** gate on top of the built-in
blackout/term checks. Instead of hand-maintaining a `blackout_dates` list, a
schedule can subscribe to a calendar the organisation already publishes and let
its all-day events drive the wake decision — the exact "follow the school/term
calendar instead of a dumb weekday cron" workflow the feature was requested for.

A **`wol_calendar`** row is a subscribed feed in one of two kinds:

- **iCal `.ics` URL** (`kind = "ical_url"`) — an unauthenticated (or
  token-in-URL) `.ics` / `webcal://` feed. This is the MVP path and covers the
  80% case: Google Calendar "public address in iCal format" links and most
  published school / district holiday calendars. `webcal://` and `webcals://`
  are normalised to `https://` before fetch.
- **Authenticated CalDAV** (`kind = "caldav"`) — a `username` + password
  collection on a CalDAV server (Nextcloud, Radicale, a school's own server).
  This is the HomeAssistant-CalDAV path the original requester described. The
  password is **Fernet-encrypted at rest** and is **never returned** by the API
  — reads expose only a `password_set` boolean.

On each refresh the reconciler pulls the feed, parses it with `icalendar`
(CalDAV collections via the `caldav` client), and **flattens all-day VEVENTs
into concrete date spans** in the child `wol_calendar_event` table
(`starts_on` / `ends_on` inclusive, `summary`, `categories`, `uid`).
Recurrence (`RRULE` / `RDATE`, minus `EXDATE`) is expanded via
`python-dateutil` over a bounded forward horizon (~400 days) so a
`FREQ=YEARLY` rule can't produce an unbounded set. Only all-day events count —
a timed 09:00 meeting is ignored; a holiday / term calendar is all-day spans.
`DTEND` is treated as RFC 5545-exclusive, so a stored `ends_on` is
`DTEND − 1 day`. The flattened spans make the fire-time gate an O(events)
in-memory check with no per-fire network call — the same last-known-good-cache
shape the DNS blocklist feed uses, so a schedule keeps gating correctly even
while the feed source is unreachable.

**Two gate modes** (`wol_schedule.calendar_mode`) cover the two shapes schools
actually publish:

| Mode | Calendar shape | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `skip_on_event` | **Holiday** calendar (events = days off) | A matching event covering the local fire date **skips** the wake (`skip_reason = "calendar_event"`) |
| `only_on_event` | **School-day / term** calendar (events = days on) | The wake fires **only** when a matching event covers the local fire date; otherwise skipped (`skip_reason = "no_calendar_event"`) |
| `none` (default) | — | Calendar ignored; pure Phase-1 built-in gating |

**`calendar_match`** (optional, per-schedule) is a case-insensitive regex that
narrows *which* events count — matched against each event's summary and its
categories. Use it when one calendar carries mixed entries and only some are
wake-relevant (e.g. `calendar_match = "closed|holiday"` on a shared calendar
that also holds staff-PD days). A malformed regex is treated as "no filter" so
a bad operator entry can never wedge the gate.

The calendar is an **additional** gate: the built-in term-range and
`blackout_dates` checks still run first (term → blackout → calendar), and the
whole thing is evaluated on the **local** fire date in the schedule's timezone.
A skipped fire is still written as a `wol_run` row with the calendar skip
reason, so "skipped — holiday calendar" stays visible in history.

**Refresh cadence + sync-now.** Each calendar carries a
`refresh_interval_minutes` cadence (default 6 h). A 60 s beat sweep
(`app.tasks.wol_calendar.sweep_wol_calendars`) reconciles every enabled
calendar whose interval has elapsed, mirroring the DNS-blocklist feed pull —
transient network failures set `last_sync_status = "error"` + `last_sync_error`
and retry with backoff; a successful pull stamps `last_synced_at` and
recomputes `event_count`. The Calendars tab surfaces last-synced status and an
**upcoming-events preview** so an operator can confirm "yes, this feed marks our
holidays" before wiring a schedule to it, plus a **Sync now** button that runs
the reconcile inline for immediate feedback.

The `wol_calendar` tables belong to the **same** `tools.wake_scheduler` feature
module as Phase 1 (no new module). Deleting a calendar `SET NULL`s the
`calendar_id` on any schedule referencing it — the schedule falls back to its
built-in gate rather than erroring.

#### Post-wake verify + retry (Phase 3)

A wake that *sent* isn't proof a host *came up*. When `verify_enabled` is set, a
run chains a non-blocking liveness check after it dispatches, probes each host
that was actually sent a packet, and re-wakes the ones that didn't answer — up to
a bound. This turns "did we fire?" into "did the fleet actually power on?".

Per-schedule config (all on `wol_schedule`):

- `verify_enabled` (default `false`) — arm the post-wake check.
- `verify_wait_seconds` (default `60`, range 5–3600) — grace between the dispatch
  (and between each retry pass) and the probe, so a host has time to POST + bring
  its NIC up before it's pinged.
- `verify_retries` (default `1`, range 0–10) — number of **re-wake** passes after
  the first probe. Total probe passes ≤ `verify_retries + 1`; `0` == probe once,
  never re-wake.
- `verify_method` (default `auto` for new schedules; existing rows keep `ping`) —
  which liveness source settles the verdict. See **Liveness sources** below.
- `verify_alert_enabled` (default `true`) — per-schedule mute for the
  `wol_wake_failed` alert. See **Alerting on a failed wake** below.

#### Liveness sources (#596)

| method | class | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ping` | active | ICMP echo from the control plane. The pre-#596 behaviour. A host behind a default Windows firewall answers nothing and reads as down. |
| `tcp` | active | Connect-or-RST across a small port set (22, 80, 443, 445, 3389, 8006, 53, 8080 — the same set the IPAM discovery sweep uses). A **refused** connection still proves the host is up, so this survives an ICMP-blocking host firewall. |
| `seen` | passive | Emits no traffic. Confirms the host only if `IPAddress.last_seen_at >= run.started_at`. |
| `auto` | both | `ping` → `tcp` → `seen`, stopping at the first source that confirms. |

Two properties make this safe to default to `auto`:

- **Active probes may report either verdict; a passive probe may only ever
  *confirm*.** "No sighting" is equally consistent with "the SNMP poller hasn't run
  yet", so `seen` never asserts a host is down. A richer method can therefore only
  ever *shrink* the down set relative to `ping` — it can never manufacture a re-wake.
- **The wake anchor kills the stale-cache false positive.** A sighting only counts
  if it was recorded *after this run's magic packet went out*. A week-old ARP entry
  or yesterday's lease can never be mistaken for evidence that the wake worked.

`auto` short-circuits, so a live ICMP-responsive host costs exactly one ping and the
extra sources are only paid for on hosts a ping-only verify would have re-woken for
nothing. A **passive** confirmation never re-stamps `last_seen_at` — the sighting is
already recorded by whichever subsystem actually observed the host. Only an **active**
UP verdict writes Seen, with `last_seen_method` set to the winning probe.

What `seen` actually observes today: the SNMP ARP/FDB cross-reference, DHCP lease
pulls, nmap, ping/ARP discovery sweeps, and the DHCP agent's passive L2
fingerprinting — every writer of `IPAddress.last_seen_at`. **The read-only
integration mirrors (UniFi, OPNsense, Proxmox, Tailscale) do not stamp `last_seen_at`**,
so they contribute no sightings. Teaching them to is a follow-up.

The per-target `wol_run_target.verify_method` records the source that *settled* the
verdict (`ping` / `tcp` / `seen`) — never the `auto` keyword — so the History chip
stays honest about how each host was confirmed.

How it runs (chained, bounded, idempotent — non-negotiables #9):

1. `run_wol_schedule` dispatches as usual, then — if `verify_enabled` and at least
   one packet went out — enqueues `verify_wol_run(run_id, attempt=1)` with a
   `verify_wait_seconds` countdown. The dispatch task never blocks on the probe.
2. Each verify pass atomically claims the run (`verify_state` `pending → verifying`
   via a conditional `UPDATE … WHERE verify_state='pending'`), so a double-delivery
   of the same attempt is a no-op and a re-fire after `done` is a no-op.
3. It probes the still-unverified **sent** targets under the schedule's
   `verify_method`. A host confirmed by an *active* probe is stamped `verified=true`
   and its `IPAddress.last_seen_at` / `last_seen_method` are updated (the same Seen
   infra discovery uses). A host confirmed only by `seen` is `verified=true` without
   re-stamping Seen. A host no source confirmed is `verified=false`. A host **no
   source could run against** — no address under an active-only method, or no IPAM
   row (`ip_address_id IS NULL`, the FK is `ON DELETE SET NULL`) under `seen` — stays
   `verified=null`: honestly "not checked", counted as unverified in the rollup, and
   never a re-wake candidate.
4. If non-responders remain **and** `attempt ≤ verify_retries`, it re-wakes **only**
   those hosts (reusing the Phase-1 dispatch path), bumps their `wake_attempts`,
   releases the run back to `pending`, and re-enqueues the next attempt. Otherwise
   it finalises: `verify_state='done'`, rolls up `verified_count` /
   `unverified_count`, and writes one `wol_run_verified` audit row.

Read surfaces: `wol_run.verify_state` (`none` → `pending` → `verifying` → `done`) +
`verified_count` / `unverified_count` on the run; per-host `wol_run_target.verified`
(tri-state: `null` = not-yet/not-checked · `false` = probed down · `true` = probed
up), `verified_at`, `verify_method`, `wake_attempts`. The `find_wol_runs` MCP tool
surfaces the rollup so the copilot can answer "did last night's wake bring the fleet
up?" — distinct from "did it send?".

#### Alerting on a failed wake (#596)

A finished verify that gave up used to leave exactly one audit row and page
nobody. The `wol_wake_failed` alert rule closes that. It is a normal rule on the
60 s evaluator, so channel delivery, dedupe and auto-resolve come from the shared
machinery — see [OBSERVABILITY.md §9.1](../OBSERVABILITY.md) for the rule table.

Two decisions worth knowing:

- **The subject is the schedule, not the run.** A 15-minute schedule that fails
  every fire would otherwise open ~96 events a day. One open event per failing
  schedule carries the blast-radius rollup (`N of M hosts`, a hostname sample).
- **It re-checks passively on every tick.** A target counts as still-failed only
  if `IPAddress.last_seen_at` is *still* older than the run that woke it. So the
  lab PC that boots twenty minutes late closes its own alert, and an operator is
  never paged for a host that has since come up. A target with no IPAM row can't
  be re-checked and keeps the alert open rather than silently resolving.

The rule seeds **disabled** (`rogue_dhcp` precedent) — enable it under
Administration → Alerts once a schedule arms verify. `verify_alert_enabled` on
the schedule is the per-schedule mute for a deliberately-noisy lab job.

#### Per-target evidence trail (#596)

`wol_run_target.verify_method` records which source *settled* a host's verdict.
`verify_evidence` records what every source it consulted actually said — an
ordered JSONB array of `{source, up, detail, observed_at}`, rendered under each
host's chip in the run's History drilldown. It answers the operator's real
question about a down host: *down according to what?* "ICMP timed out, no TCP
port answered, no sighting since the wake" is a dead box; a short-circuit trail
that stops at `ping · up` means nothing else was ever needed. `NULL` on rows no
source could run against, and on rows recorded before the trail shipped.

Two Operator Copilot reads surface the same data: `find_wol_wake_failures` (runs
whose verify finished with unconfirmed hosts — scheduled *and* ad-hoc, newest
first) and `count_wol_wake_failures`. Both read-only, both default-enabled.

#### Ad-hoc wake verify (#596)

The single-host wake action (`POST /ipam/addresses/{id}/wake`, the **Wake** button on
the IP detail modal) can arm the same chain. Tick **verify** next to the button, or
pass `verify: true` with optional `verify_wait_seconds` / `verify_retries` /
`verify_method`. Because the machinery is keyed on a run, an opted-in ad-hoc wake
mints an ephemeral `WolRun` with `schedule_id = NULL`, `trigger = "adhoc"` and a
single target, and carries its config in `WolRun.verify_params` — there is no parent
schedule row to read it from. The run appears in **Wake Schedules → History** like any
other. Requires the `tools.wake_scheduler` feature module (422 otherwise — the run
would otherwise be invisible in the UI and never reclaimed by the sweep). A failing
ad-hoc wake raises no alert: alerting is keyed on a schedule subject, and an ad-hoc
run has none.

**ACTIVE probes run from the SERVER vantage only**, regardless of the schedule's *wake*
vantage. The appliance command channel (`agent_cmd`) is an in-memory, per-replica
dispatch the **api** process owns; the verify task runs in the **Celery worker**, and
there is no worker→supervisor result-return path today. So for an appliance-vantage
wake, an active probe still runs from the control plane: correct when the api/worker
can reach the target segment (routed ICMP / directed broadcast), and a false-negative
(unverified) — never a false wake — when it can't. **`seen` sidesteps this entirely**:
it is a pure DB read, so it verifies hosts on segments the worker cannot reach at all,
provided some other subsystem (an SNMP poll of the local switch, a DHCP lease)
observed them — which is why `auto` is the sensible default on a segmented network.
**Appliance-vantage *active* verify** (a worker→supervisor result channel) remains the
named follow-up, alongside the
deferred [auto-resolve on-segment appliance from the target subnet] and the
[scheduled-shutdown companion] below.

#### Vantage

A schedule inherits the #533 vantage choice — where the magic packet
originates:

- **Server vantage** (`{ "kind": "server" }`, default) — the control-plane
  container broadcasts. Reaches only segments the api container can reach
  directly, unless the target router forwards a directed broadcast (see the
  router matrix below).
- **Fleet-appliance vantage** (`{ "kind": "appliance", "id": <uuid> }`) —
  dispatch to a Fleet appliance whose NIC sits on the target's segment, so the
  packet originates in the right broadcast domain (reuses the generic nettool
  command channel). **This is the preferred path** when an appliance is on the
  segment — it needs no router changes at all.

  > ⚠️ **Scheduled fires can't use appliance vantage yet.** The appliance
  > command channel (`agent_cmd`) is an **in-memory, per-replica** queue that the
  > supervisor long-polls off the **api** process, but a scheduled fire runs in
  > the **Celery beat worker** — a different process — so its enqueue never
  > reaches the supervisor and the wake records per-host delivery failures (it is
  > not silent, but it does not send). This is the same agent_cmd limitation the
  > verify probe hits above; the fix is the tracked worker→supervisor
  > Redis-backed multi-replica dispatch. **Until then, for a *scheduled* wake to a
  > remote segment use server vantage + the router directed-broadcast config
  > (below), or trigger the appliance-vantage wake interactively via "Run now"
  > (which originates in the api process and reaches the supervisor).**

#### Stagger auto-tuning (Phase 3)

`stagger_ms` inserts a per-host delay between sends within a run (on top of the
`repeat_count` / `repeat_interval_ms` per-host retry burst). Firing every magic
packet back-to-back can spike inrush current on a rack (dozens of machines powering
on simultaneously) and micro-burst the broadcast domain / a PXE boot server.

As of Phase 3 the default `stagger_ms = 0` means **auto**: the runner ramps a large
resolved fleet so a same-second all-at-once fire can't inrush / PXE-thundering-herd,
while a small set still fires immediately. The bands (`auto_stagger_ms`):

| resolved wake count | stagger | approx wakes/sec |
|---|---|---|
| ≤ 20 | 0 (all at once) | — |
| 21 – 100 | 50 ms | ~20/s |
| 101 – 256 | 100 ms | ~10/s |
| > 256 (up to the 512 fan-out cap) | 150 ms | ~6–7/s |

Any **positive** `stagger_ms` is an explicit operator override that always wins
verbatim — auto never touches it. So `0` = "let the platform decide", and a specific
value = "use exactly this ramp". The `preview-targets` surface returns a
`suggested_stagger_ms` (the auto value for the resolved count) so the create modal can
show "waking N hosts → suggest ~X ms" as the operator edits the selector; the
`preview_wol_schedule_targets` MCP tool returns it too.

#### Scope caveat — wake only

Wake-on-LAN **only wakes**. There is no "scheduled shutdown" counterpart, and
none of Phases 1–3 add one — WoL is a layer-2 magic packet with no reverse
operation, and an orderly shutdown needs an authenticated out-of-band path
(BMC / Redfish / IPMI) or in-guest agent (SSH / ACPI) that is out of scope here.
The **scheduled-shutdown companion** (BMC/Redfish/IPMI power-off) is a deferred
follow-up the issue flags as "investigate" — a separate feature, not this pass.
Schedules turn machines **on**; turning them off is the operator's / OS's
responsibility.

#### FOG / PXE re-image runbook (Phase 3)

A scheduled wake pairs cleanly with the shipped **DHCP PXE profiles** (#51:
`pxe_profile` + `DHCPScope.pxe_profile_id`, iPXE-vs-BIOS client-class match) to drive
lab / classroom re-imaging with a tool like [FOG](https://fogproject.org/). The flow:

1. **Tag the machines** to re-image (e.g. `wake:reimage`) so a `subnet_tags` /
   `address_tags` selector resolves exactly that set.
2. **Point the scope's PXE profile at FOG.** With a `pxe_profile` on the target
   DHCP scope, PXE-booting hosts get the FOG bootfile (BIOS) or the FOG iPXE script
   (iPXE) via the shipped client-class match — see `docs/features/DHCP.md` PXE
   profiles.
3. **Wake at the imaging window.** A schedule with cron `0 2 L * *` (02:00 on the
   last day of the term — combined with the built-in `active_until` gate) wakes the
   tagged fleet; a manual-only schedule + `run-now` works for an ad-hoc re-image.
4. **Hosts PXE-boot into FOG** and image per the FOG task queued for each host.

Operational notes: leave `stagger_ms = 0` (auto) or set a non-trivial explicit stagger
so a lab-full of machines doesn't PXE-thundering-herd the TFTP / HTTP boot server all
in the same second (the auto bands above already ramp a large set). Turn on
**post-wake verify** so you can confirm the fleet actually powered on before the
imaging window closes — `unverified_count > 0` on the run means some hosts never came
up (dead PSU, WoL disabled in BIOS, wrong segment). This runbook **pairs with** but
does **not** implement the deferred scheduled-shutdown companion (above): re-image jobs
that need the machines off afterward still rely on the OS / FOG task to power them down.

### Directed-broadcast router matrix (server vantage across an L3 boundary)

**Prefer a Fleet appliance on the target segment — it needs none of this.**
When the wake is dispatched to an appliance whose NIC is on the target subnet,
the magic packet is broadcast locally and no router configuration is required.

The snippets below are the **fallback** for when there is *no* on-segment
appliance and the packet must travel from the **server vantage** across a
routed boundary. In that case delivery depends on the target router
**forwarding a directed broadcast** to the subnet's broadcast address. That is
disabled by default on virtually all modern gear — it is the classic
smurf-amplification vector — so server-vantage cross-subnet wakes silently fail
until the operator enables it.

Enabling directed broadcast is a **security downgrade**. Every snippet below
therefore scopes the forwarding to **our single sender only**, via an ACL /
firewall filter pinned to `<sender-ip>` → the target subnet. **Never** widen
the source to `any` — that re-opens the smurf reflector. The schedule modal
renders these auto-filled from what the job already knows, in an expandable
"Router setup help" block shown only for a server-vantage + remote/L3 target.

Templated fields (auto-filled by the UI, shown as placeholders here):

| Placeholder | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `<sender-ip>` | The server/appliance vantage's source IP (the *only* permitted source) |
| `<target-cidr>` | The target subnet in CIDR (rendered as network + wildcard/mask per vendor) |
| `<target-directed-broadcast>` | The subnet's directed-broadcast address (computed via `wol.broadcast_for_network`) |
| `<wol-port>` | The schedule's UDP port (default `9`; some stacks also use `7`) |

Worked example used below: `<sender-ip> = 10.0.0.5`, target subnet
`192.168.10.0/24` → `<target-cidr> = 192.168.10.0/24`,
`<target-directed-broadcast> = 192.168.10.255`, `<wol-port> = 9`.

#### Cisco IOS / IOS-XE

```
access-list 110 permit udp host 10.0.0.5 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 9
!
interface Vlan10
 ip directed-broadcast 110
```

`host 10.0.0.5` = `<sender-ip>`; `192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255` = `<target-cidr>` as
network + wildcard mask; `eq 9` = `<wol-port>`. The ACL scopes
`ip directed-broadcast` on the target's downstream interface to only our
sender → the subnet, so it is not left open as a smurf reflector.

#### Juniper Junos

```
firewall {
    family inet {
        filter WOL-ONLY {
            term permit-wol {
                from {
                    source-address {
                        10.0.0.5/32;
                    }
                    destination-address {
                        192.168.10.255/32;
                    }
                    protocol udp;
                    destination-port [ 7 9 ];
                }
                then accept;
            }
            term default {
                then accept;   # or your normal policy
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`10.0.0.5/32` = `<sender-ip>`; `192.168.10.255/32` =
`<target-directed-broadcast>`; ports `7 9` = WoL. Junos also needs the
receiving IRB/interface for the target subnet to permit the directed broadcast
(`set interfaces irb unit <n> family inet targeted-broadcast`) alongside the
filter — the filter authorises the traffic, `targeted-broadcast` converts the
inbound directed-broadcast into a link-layer broadcast on egress.

#### Arista EOS

```
ip access-list WOL-ONLY
   10 permit udp host 10.0.0.5 192.168.10.0/24 eq 9
!
interface Vlan10
   ip directed-broadcast WOL-ONLY
```

IOS-like: `host 10.0.0.5` = `<sender-ip>`, `192.168.10.0/24` = `<target-cidr>`,
`eq 9` = `<wol-port>`. `ip directed-broadcast <acl>` on the SVI facing the
target subnet forwards directed broadcasts only for ACL-matched traffic.

#### MikroTik RouterOS

```
/ip firewall filter
add chain=forward action=accept protocol=udp \
    src-address=10.0.0.5 dst-address=192.168.10.255 \
    dst-port=9 comment="WOL directed-broadcast (single sender)"
/interface ethernet switch
# RouterOS drops directed broadcasts by default; the forward-accept rule
# above pins src-address=<sender-ip> (10.0.0.5) to the subnet's
# directed-broadcast dst-address=<target-directed-broadcast> (192.168.10.255)
# on dst-port=<wol-port> (9). Keep src-address pinned — never 0.0.0.0/0.
```

`src-address=10.0.0.5` = `<sender-ip>`; `dst-address=192.168.10.255` =
`<target-directed-broadcast>`; `dst-port=9` = `<wol-port>`. On CHR / routers
that also need the broadcast re-broadcast onto the LAN segment, ensure the
target bridge/interface is not filtering the directed broadcast in the bridge
firewall.

#### VyOS / EdgeOS

```
set firewall name WOL-ONLY rule 10 action accept
set firewall name WOL-ONLY rule 10 protocol udp
set firewall name WOL-ONLY rule 10 source address 10.0.0.5
set firewall name WOL-ONLY rule 10 destination address 192.168.10.255
set firewall name WOL-ONLY rule 10 destination port 9
!
# Enable directed-broadcast relay on the interface facing the target subnet:
set interfaces ethernet eth1 ip enable-directed-broadcast
```

`source address 10.0.0.5` = `<sender-ip>`; `destination address
192.168.10.255` = `<target-directed-broadcast>`; `destination port 9` =
`<wol-port>`. `enable-directed-broadcast` on the egress interface converts the
routed directed broadcast into a link-layer broadcast; the firewall rule pins
it to our single sender. Apply the `WOL-ONLY` ruleset to the appropriate
`in`/`local` direction for your topology.

#### pfSense / OPNsense

Both are FreeBSD/`pf`-based and disable directed-broadcast forwarding by
default. Add a **single-source** firewall pass rule on the interface the wake
enters from:

```
# Firewall → Rules → <WAN/vantage interface> → Add
Action:            Pass
Protocol:          UDP
Source:            10.0.0.5/32            # <sender-ip> — Single host, never "any"
Destination:       192.168.10.255/32     # <target-directed-broadcast>
Destination port:  9                     # <wol-port>
```

Then allow the directed broadcast to be forwarded onto the LAN. On FreeBSD this
is the `net.inet.ip.directed-broadcast=1` sysctl (System → Advanced →
System Tunables), scoped in practice by the source-pinned pass rule above.
Several SpatiumDDI integrations already mirror OPNsense/pfSense, so the target
subnet + directed-broadcast address are typically already known to the platform
and pre-filled into this snippet. Keep the source pinned to `<sender-ip>/32` —
a rule with `Source: any` re-opens the smurf reflector.

## 6. Custom Fields

Both **Subnets** and **IPAddresses** (and **IPBlocks** and **DNSZones**) support administrator-defined custom fields. This allows organizations to store domain-specific metadata without schema changes.

### Custom Field Definition

```
CustomFieldDefinition
  id
  resource_type: enum(subnet, ip_address, ip_block, dns_zone, dhcp_scope)
  name: str               -- snake_case key (e.g., "ticket_number")
  label: str              -- human-readable (e.g., "Change Ticket")
  field_type: enum(text, number, boolean, date, email, url, select, multi_select)
  options: JSONB (nullable)  -- for select/multi_select: list of allowed values
  is_required: bool
  is_searchable: bool        -- if true, indexed for search
  default_value: str (nullable)
  display_order: int
  description: str
```

### Example Custom Fields for Subnets

| Field Name | Type | Example Value |
|---|---|---|
| `managed_by` | text | "Network Team - Alice Smith" |
| `contact_email` | email | "netops@example.com" |
| `ticket_number` | text | "CHG-45678" |
| `environment` | select | "production" / "staging" / "dev" |
| `cost_center` | text | "CC-1234" |
| `decom_date` | date | "2025-12-31" |
| `notes` | text | Free-form notes |

### Custom Fields in the API

Custom fields are exposed under the `custom_fields` JSONB key on all resource objects. They are validated against their `CustomFieldDefinition` on write.

## 7. Import / Export

### IP Range Import

Supported input formats:
- **CSV**: columns: `network`, `name`, `gateway`, `vlan_id`, `description` + any custom field columns
- **JSON**: array of subnet objects (matches API schema)
- **IPAM vendor exports**: generic CSV (network, name, gateway, vlan_id), SolarWinds IPAM CSV, Netbox JSON

Import behavior:
- **Dry run first**: always show a preview table of what will be created/updated before committing
- **Conflict handling**: `skip` / `update` / `error` on existing networks (selectable per import)
- **Parent detection**: automatically places imported subnets under the correct block in the hierarchy
- **Custom fields**: mapped by column name / JSON key

### IP Range Export

- Export a block, subnet, or entire space
- Formats: CSV, JSON, Excel (`.xlsx`)
- Includes: all subnet metadata + utilization + custom fields + IP address list (optional)

### DNS Zone Import / Export

- **Import**: RFC 1035 zone file format → creates zone + all records in IPAM + pushes to DNS server
- **Export**: Export zone as RFC 1035 zone file or JSON
- Bulk import of multiple zones via ZIP of zone files

### NetBox migration import (#36)

For migrating a whole IPAM estate out of a live NetBox install — prefixes / IP
addresses / VRFs / tenants → Customers / sites / VLANs in one preview → commit
pass — use the dedicated **NetBox importer** rather than the generic CSV/JSON
range import above. See `docs/features/MIGRATION.md` § "NetBox → IPAM importer".

## 8. Discovery / Reconciliation

> **Status (issue #23): shipped.** Opt-in per subnet — default off,
> because a sweep is only meaningful for subnets the SpatiumDDI worker
> can actually route to, and unsolicited probes can trip an IDS.

> **Fragile devices: `do_not_probe` (issue #722).** Medical- and

> `docs/features/VERTICALS.md` § "Fragile-device probe suppression".

### IP Discovery

A per-subnet-opt-in Celery sweep discovers IPs that are live but not
recorded in IPAM. Enable it on a subnet (Edit Subnet → *IP discovery*)
and set the sweep interval; a beat dispatcher (`dispatch_due_subnets`,
ticks every 60 s) queues `run_subnet_discovery` for each subnet whose
`discovery_interval_minutes` has elapsed since its `last_discovery_at`.
Interval changes take effect without restarting beat. Operators can
also sweep on demand: **Tools → Reconcile (IP discovery) → Discover
now**, or `POST /api/v1/ipam/subnets/{id}/discover`.

Methods (run together per pass):
- **Ping sweep** — pure-Python asyncio using an *unprivileged*
  `SOCK_DGRAM` ICMP socket. When that socket can't be created (the
  worker's uid is outside `net.ipv4.ping_group_range`), it falls back
  to a TCP-connect probe across a small set of common ports — a
  connect success **or** a connection-refused (RST) both prove the host
  is up. No raw sockets / CAP_NET_RAW required.
- **ARP scan** — reads the worker's own ARP cache (`/proc/net/arp`).
  Only useful for subnets the worker is L2-adjacent to, but it catches
  hosts that drop ICMP and enriches `mac_address`.
- **SNMP polling** — ARP tables pulled from routers/switches (already
  shipped separately; feeds the same `last_seen_at` columns).

Reconciliation writes (`services/ipam/discovery.reconcile_subnet`):
- existing rows → `last_seen_at` / `last_seen_method` refreshed (MAC
  filled only when NULL — operator data is never overwritten);
- live IPs with no row → inserted `status='discovered'`, **unless** the
  IP is in a dynamic DHCP pool (owned by the DHCP server) or is the
  network / broadcast address.

Operator-locked rows (`user_modified_at` set) keep their status; a
sweep only refreshes their `last_seen_at`. Subnets larger than a /20
(`MAX_SWEEP_HOSTS = 4096`) and IPv6 subnets are skipped.

### Reconciliation Report

`GET /api/v1/ipam/subnets/{id}/reconciliation?stale_minutes=1440`
(also surfaced to the Operator Copilot as `find_subnet_reconciliation`):

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| `in_ipam_not_seen` | Allocated / reserved / static but nothing answered within the stale window |
| `discovered_not_allocated` | Live on the wire but never formally allocated |
| `status_mismatch` | Marked `available` but a host is answering right now |

`stale_minutes` (default 24 h) is the window after which a row's
`last_seen_at` counts as stale.

### New-device detection — arpwatch-style (issue #459)

Behind the default-**off** `security.new_device_watch` feature module
(group **Security**), SpatiumDDI alerts the moment a **never-before-seen
MAC** appears on the network — the classic arpwatch "new station"
behaviour, for operators who want a real-time heads-up on anything that
joins.

**One store, not two.** Rather than a parallel sighting table, the
feature extends the existing `ip_mac_history` observation log (the same
store that feeds the `unknown_mac_in_static_range` alert above) with a
classification layer:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `classification` | `new` (never seen — raises the alert) · `acknowledged` (operator dismissed this `(ip, mac)`) · `known` (allowlisted, or on an allocated/reserved/static IP) |
| `source` | which path first/last saw it — `sweep` · `snmp` · `dhcp_lease` · `l2_sniff` |
| `is_randomized` | the MAC's locally-administered (privacy-randomised) bit is set — flagged, and skipped by the default alert so reconnecting phones don't storm |

**Detection sources** (all route through
`record_mac_observation`, which classifies on first sight):

1. **DHCP leases** — the agent's lease-event stream (zero-effort, the
   lowest-friction source).
2. **SNMP ARP/FDB** — the existing device-poll cross-reference
   (agentless).
3. **L2 sniff** — an opt-in arpwatch-style ARP/ND sniffer on the DHCP
   agent (`DHCP_MAC_SIGHTING_ENABLED=1`, needs `cap_add: NET_RAW`),
   catching devices that never DHCP (static IP, link-local). Ships to
   `POST /api/v1/dhcp/agents/mac-sightings`.

**Allowlist.** A `mac_allowlist` table of trusted MACs (or **OUI
prefixes** for VMs/containers — `POST /new-devices/allowlist/virt-defaults`
seeds the well-known virtualisation OUIs) that never alert and reclassify
matching sightings to `known`. Keyed on the MAC, so it survives the
cascade-delete of any IP it was first seen on.

**Alert + events.** The `new_mac_seen` alert rule (seeded disabled) opens
one `AlertEvent` per `(ip, mac)` sighting classified `new`, auto-resolving
once acknowledged / allowlisted or aged out (set its `classification` to
`"all"` to include randomised MACs). Genuinely-new devices also fire a
real-time `device.first_seen` typed webhook event (and
`device.acknowledged` on dismissal) on **ingest** — sub-minute, ahead of
the 60 s alert tick.

**Operator surface.** `GET /new-devices/{summary,sightings,allowlist}` +
acknowledge / baseline-import / allowlist / block actions
(`/api/v1/new-devices`, gated on `read`/`write` `ip_address`). The
**Tools → New Devices** review queue lists sightings with one-click
**Acknowledge / Add to allowlist / Block** (block creates a
`DHCPMACBlock` — arpwatch with teeth). Run a **baseline import** when
arming the feature to mark the existing fleet as `known` so day-one isn't
a wall of alerts. Operator-Copilot tools: `find_new_devices` /
`count_new_devices` / `find_mac_allowlist` (read) +
`propose_acknowledge_device` / `propose_allowlist_mac` /
`propose_block_mac` (Apply-gated writes).

### Stale-IP Report (issue #45)

A cross-subnet "address-space hygiene" view that reads the discovery
`last_seen_at` signal from the other direction: which IPs are still
marked `allocated` but haven't been seen on the wire in *N* days?
Those are reclaim candidates — hosts decommissioned without anyone
freeing the IPAM row.

`GET /api/v1/ipam/reports/stale-ips?stale_days=90&include_never_seen=false`
(also surfaced to the Operator Copilot as `find_stale_ips`):

- **Candidate status** is `allocated` only — `reserved` / `static_dhcp`
  are deliberately held, and DHCP-lease mirrors (`auto_from_lease`)
  churn on their own cadence, so all of those are excluded.
- **Stale** means `last_seen_at` older than the cutoff. Rows that were
  *never* seen (`last_seen_at IS NULL`) are excluded by default —
  many live in subnets where discovery was never enabled — and fold in
  only with `include_never_seen=true`.
- Optional `space_id` / `block_id` / `subnet_id` scope the report.
  Stalest rows sort first (`NULLS FIRST` ascending).

**One-click bulk-deprecate.** `POST /api/v1/ipam/reports/stale-ips/deprecate`
flips stale rows to `deprecated` (reversible from the normal IP edit
path) and stamps `user_modified_at` so a later discovery / integration
sweep won't silently un-deprecate them. Provide `ip_ids` to deprecate a
hand-picked set, or `all_matching=true` with the report filter to
deprecate every matching row in one shot (capped at `MAX_BULK_DEPRECATE`
= 5000; the response `capped` flag tells the operator to re-run for the
remainder). System placeholders and DHCP mirrors are skipped even if an
id slips through. The page lives at **Stale IPs** in the sidebar.

**Hygiene alert.** A `stale_ip_count` alert rule fires when any subnet
holds at least `threshold_percent` (re-used as a raw count) allocated
IPs older than `threshold_days` (default 90). It reads the same signal
but excludes never-seen rows so the passive feed stays high-confidence;
operators chase the full list, including never-seen, from the report.

### Reverse-DNS auto-population (issue #41)

A scheduled, platform-opt-in sweep that names IP rows from reverse DNS.
The reverse-DNS beat task (every 60 s, gated on `reverse_dns_enabled` +
`reverse_dns_interval_minutes`) finds rows where `hostname IS NULL`,
issues a PTR lookup against the configured resolvers, and fills:

- `hostname` ← the **short, leftmost label** of the PTR FQDN
  (`server01` from `server01.corp.example.com`);
- `description` ← the **full PTR FQDN**, but **only when the description
  is currently empty** so an operator's note is never clobbered. (The
  dedicated `fqdn` column is intentionally left to the forward-DNS sync,
  which derives it from the assigned zone.)

Candidate rows are `allocated` / `reserved` / `static_dhcp` /
`discovered` only. Rows whose hostname is authoritative from an upstream
integration are skipped — anything carrying an integration provenance FK
(Docker / Kubernetes / Proxmox / Tailscale / UniFi) or `auto_from_lease`
(a DHCP lease mirror). `discovered` rows *are* included because
ping/ARP/nmap discovery (#23) never provides a hostname. The sweep only
ever touches `hostname IS NULL` rows, so it never overwrites a name.

Configured under **Settings → IPAM → Reverse DNS (PTR)**: enable toggle,
sweep interval, and a comma-separated resolver list (blank = the
worker's system resolvers). A **Run now** button queues an on-demand
sweep (`POST /api/v1/settings/reverse-dns/run`) that bypasses the
enabled-gate + interval. Each sweep writes one summary audit row.

## 9. Utilization Tracking

- `Subnet.utilization_percent` is computed and stored (updated on every IP change + on schedule)
- `IPBlock.utilization_percent` is computed by rolling up child subnet utilization
- Alerts are configured in the notification system when utilization exceeds thresholds (default: warn at 80%, critical at 95%)

---

## 10. Global search

`GET /api/v1/search`, and the Cmd/Ctrl+K palette over it, reach well past
IPAM — twenty resource types across IPAM, DNS, DHCP, Network and
Administration. `GET /api/v1/search/types` returns the subset the calling
user may search, which is what the palette's scope chips are built from.

**Query shapes.** The query string is classified once, and only the
providers that could match that shape run:

| Shape | Example | Reaches |
|---|---|---|
| IP | `10.0.0.42` | exact address, containing subnet/block, DNS records whose *value* is that address, reservations, devices, server hosts |
| CIDR | `10.0.0.0/24` | subnets and blocks within the range |
| MAC | `aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff` | addresses and DHCP reservations |
| Text | `web-01` | names, hostnames, FQDNs, record values, descriptions, searchable custom fields |

MAC matching is separator-insensitive in both directions: the stored value
and the query are both reduced to bare hex, so a dashed query finds a
colon-form row, and a partial MAC (an OUI prefix) works too.

**Ranking.** Hits are scored exact (100) > prefix (60) > substring (25),
plus a small per-type weight used only to break ties within a bucket. The
score is computed **in SQL, before each type's `LIMIT`** — otherwise the
database is free to return any N matching rows and the exact hit is
routinely not among them, which no amount of re-sorting afterwards can
fix. The returned `score` and `matched_field` make the ordering
inspectable rather than something to infer.

**Permissions.** Every type is filtered against the caller's own `read`
permission and the install's enabled feature modules, server-side
(non-negotiable #3). A type the caller cannot read is dropped from the
request rather than rejected, so a stale scope chip returns nothing for
that scope instead of failing the whole search. `user` is superadmin-only,
matching `/api/v1/users`.

**Indexing.** `pg_trgm` GIN indexes back the leading-wildcard `ILIKE`
matches on the tables that grow large — `ip_address`, `dns_record`,
`dns_zone`, `subnet`, `dhcp_static_assignment` (migration
`f4b91d38a70c`). Small tables are deliberately left unindexed: a
sequential scan of a few hundred rows is already the fastest plan and a
GIN index there is pure write amplification. Queries shorter than three
characters produce no full trigram and still scan; the palette is
debounced and those match nearly everything anyway. If `CREATE EXTENSION
pg_trgm` is refused on a locked-down managed instance, the migration logs
and skips the indexes — search degrades to sequential scans rather than
failing the upgrade.

One known cost remains: matching *custom-field* values uses
`custom_fields ->> 'name' ILIKE …`, which no trigram index can serve
because the field name is chosen at runtime. On a table with hundreds of
thousands of addresses that is a sequential scan of a few tens of
milliseconds. Indexing it would mean creating an expression index when an
operator flags a field searchable — worth doing, not yet done.

## 11. UI Conventions

### Combined IPAM Tree View

The left-side IPAM menu expands into a unified tree view. There are no separate "IP Spaces" and "Subnets" pages — everything is a single hierarchical tree:

<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/diagrams/ipam-tree-ui.svg" alt="Combined IPAM tree navigator" width="900"/>
</p>

Clicking a subnet opens its IP address list panel on the right. The IP address list is **collapsible** — useful for large subnets (e.g., WiFi /16) where listing every IP is slow. A toggle "Show IP list" defaults based on subnet size (auto-collapse if > 1000 IPs).

### Subnet Column Customization

The subnet list table supports:
- **Selectable columns**: user chooses which columns to display; preferences are persisted per user
- **Sortable**: click any column header to sort ascending/descending
- **Filterable**: per-column filter chips (e.g., status = active, utilization > 80%)
- **Bulk edit**: select multiple subnets → edit common fields in bulk (name, tags, custom fields, status, VLAN ID)

The same column customization applies to IP address lists, DHCP scope lists, and DNS zone/record lists.

### Gateway Auto-Assignment

When creating a subnet, the **first usable IP** (network address + 1) is automatically designated as the gateway (`status = reserved`, `description = "Gateway"`). This can be:
- Changed to any other IP in the subnet
- Deleted if no gateway is needed (e.g., transit link)
- Overridden during import

### Parent/Child Setting Inheritance

Settings can be defined at the **IPSpace** or **IPBlock** level and inherited by child subnets, with per-subnet overrides:

| Setting | Inheritable |
|---|---|
| `domain_name` | Yes — subnet inherits space/block domain, can override |
| `dns_servers` | Yes |
| `dhcp_server_group_id` | Yes |
| `tags` | Merged (parent tags + subnet tags) |
| `custom_fields` | Merged (parent defaults + subnet overrides) |

Inheritance display: the UI shows inherited values in muted text with a "Inherited from IPBlock: 10.0.0.0/8" tooltip. Overriding a field shows an "Override" badge.

### Multiple Domains per Subnet

A subnet can be associated with multiple DNS domains. When assigning an IP address, the user selects which domain the hostname record belongs to:

```
Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24
  Domains: [corp.example.com, backup.example.com]

IPAddress: 10.0.1.42
  hostname: db-01
  domain: corp.example.com  ← selected at assignment time
  fqdn: db-01.corp.example.com (auto-computed)
```

Implementation: `SubnetDomain` junction table; `IPAddress.domain_id` (FK → DNSZone).

## 12. MAC Address / OUI Vendor Lookup

**Opt-in feature** — configured in Settings → IPAM → OUI Vendor Lookup. Off by default. When enabled, SpatiumDDI maintains a local copy of the IEEE OUI database to display vendor names next to MAC addresses in all IP and DHCP lease tables.

- **Source**: `https://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui/oui.csv` (~5 MB, ~35k prefixes)
- **Update schedule**: `app.tasks.oui_update.auto_update_oui_database` ticks hourly via Celery Beat; the task itself honours `PlatformSettings.oui_lookup_enabled` + `oui_update_interval_hours` (default 24 h) so cadence is UI-controlled without restarting beat.
- **Manual refresh**: `POST /api/v1/settings/oui/refresh` queues `app.tasks.oui_update.update_oui_database_now`, bypassing the interval gate. Exposed as a "Refresh Now" button in the Settings UI.
- **Storage**: `oui_vendor(prefix CHAR(6) PRIMARY KEY, vendor_name VARCHAR(255), updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ)`. `prefix` is the first three MAC octets as six *lowercase* hex chars (matches the canonical form `_normalize_mac` already produces).
- **Incremental diff**: each run SELECTs the current snapshot, classifies incoming rows into `added` / `updated` / `removed` / `unchanged`, and applies only the deltas inside one transaction. A prefix's `updated_at` only bumps when the vendor string actually changes — so the timestamp tracks real IEEE re-assignments, not cron ticks. A failed fetch or parse rolls back to the previous snapshot so lookups never see partial data.
- **Refresh modal**: the Settings page "Refresh Now" button opens a modal that polls `GET /api/v1/settings/oui/refresh/{task_id}` and renders `Total / Added / Updated / Removed / Unchanged` counters when the task finishes.
- **User-Agent**: the IEEE edge returns HTTP 418 to clients with the default Python-httpx UA. The fetcher presents as `SpatiumDDI-OUI-Fetcher/1.0 (+https://github.com/spatiumnorth/spatiumddi)`.
- **Display**: MACs render as `aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff (Cisco Systems)` in the IP address table and DHCP leases. The IP table's MAC column filter also matches the vendor name so `apple` / `cisco` work when operators know the maker but not the prefix. When OUI is disabled the `vendor` field is simply null on the wire and the UI falls back to the bare MAC.

---

## 12a. Address-space reports (issue #917)

Three read-only reports that answer "what is wrong with my address space
right now", each at a threshold the caller picks rather than one an alert rule
was configured with.

| Route | Answers |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/ipam/reports/stale-ips` | allocated IPs nothing has seen in N days (#45) |
| `GET /api/v1/ipam/reports/hygiene` | the three #369 hygiene detections, live |
| `GET /api/v1/ipam/reports/vendors` | device counts by hardware vendor |
| `GET /api/v1/ipam/reports/vendors/devices` | the devices behind one vendor bucket |
| `GET /api/v1/ipam/subnets/{id}/reconciliation` | per-subnet discovery reconciliation (#23) |

### Hygiene

Three buckets, all derived from the discovery `last_seen_at` / `ip_mac_history`
signals:

* **`free_but_responding`** — rows marked `available` that answered on the
  wire inside `free_responding_days`. Either the row is wrong or something is
  squatting; both matter before the address is handed out again.
* **`stale_reservations`** — `reserved` / `static_dhcp` rows nothing has seen
  in `stale_reservation_days`. Requires at least one prior sighting, so a
  subnet where discovery was never enabled does not read as dead.
* **`unknown_mac_in_static_range`** — a reservation whose recently observed
  MAC differs from the recorded one. Operator-set `mac_address` is never
  overwritten by discovery, so a differing recent observation is a genuine
  "someone else is answering on this IP".

These have existed as **alert rules** since #369, which answers "tell me when
this becomes true". The report answers "is it true right now", without
requiring a rule to have been configured — and it calls the same matchers the
evaluator does, so the two cannot disagree about what a detection means.

`counts` are the full match counts while the row lists are capped at `limit`;
`truncated` says whether any bucket was cut, so a client that received exactly
`limit` rows does not have to compare against `counts` to find out.

### Vendor rollup

Requires OUI lookup to be enabled (Settings → IPAM). When it is off the rollup
returns zero matches with an unchanged shape — `total_macs_seen` is what tells
an empty network apart from a disabled feature or a stale OUI table.

`source` selects `ipam` (managed rows), `dhcp_active` (live leases), or `all`
(the union, deduplicated by MAC — a device with both is one device).

## 12b. "Where has this MAC been?"

Per-IP MAC history is stored in `ip_mac_history` and surfaced through the
**new-device** endpoints rather than an IPAM-named one, which is not
guessable:

```
GET /api/v1/new-devices/sightings?classification=known&search=<mac>
```

Each row carries the MAC, the IP it was seen on, that IP's subnet, the OUI
vendor, and `first_seen` / `last_seen`. `classification=new` is the
unacknowledged review queue; `known` is the history. The surface is gated on
the `security.new_devices` feature module.

Pair it with `GET /api/v1/dhcp/lease-history?mac=<mac>` (see
[`DHCP.md`](DHCP.md)) for the DHCP side of the same question — that one is
fleet-wide and needs no module.

## 13. Network Device Management (SNMP Polling)

SpatiumDDI can manage a registry of **network devices** (routers, switches, access points) that are polled via SNMP to gather:
- ARP table → IP-to-MAC mappings (feeds IPAM discovery)
- FDB (forwarding database) → MAC-to-switch-port mappings (shows which switch/port a device is connected to)
- Interface information → link status, speed, VLAN assignments

This is handled by a dedicated **`snmp-poller` container** (separate from the core API).

### Network Device Model

```
NetworkDevice
  id, name, hostname, ip_address
  type: enum(router, switch, ap, firewall, other)
  vendor: str (nullable, auto-populated from SNMP sysDescr)
  snmp_version: enum(v1, v2c, v3)
  -- SNMPv2c
  community: str (encrypted)
  -- SNMPv3
  security_name: str
  auth_protocol: enum(MD5, SHA, SHA256, none)
  auth_key_ref: str
  priv_protocol: enum(DES, AES, AES256, none)
  priv_key_ref: str
  -- Polling
  poll_interval_seconds: int (default 300)
  poll_arp: bool (default true)
  poll_fdb: bool (default true)
  poll_interfaces: bool (default true)
  last_poll_at: timestamp
  last_poll_status: enum(success, failed, timeout)
  -- VRF
  vrf_aware: bool (default false)
  vrfs: [str] (nullable)   -- if vrf_aware=true, poll only these VRF names; empty = poll all VRFs
```

### VRF-Aware ARP Polling

When a router has multiple VRFs, the standard ARP table (`ipNetToMediaTable`, OID `1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22`) only returns the global routing table. To get ARP entries from named VRFs, the poller must query per-VRF using SNMP **community string indexing** (SNMPv2c) or **context names** (SNMPv3):

| SNMP Version | VRF Method |
|---|---|
| SNMPv2c | Community string `<community>@<vrf-name>` (Cisco convention) or `<community>@<vrf-rd>` |
| SNMPv3 | Context name set to the VRF name in the SNMPv3 PDU header |

When `vrf_aware = true`:
- The poller iterates over each VRF in the `vrfs` list (or discovers all VRFs via `CISCO-VRF-MIB::cvVrfName` if the list is empty)
- Each VRF's ARP table is polled separately
- Results are tagged with `vrf_name` and stored in `IPAddress.vrf_name` for display in the UI
- Duplicate IP entries across VRFs are allowed (matches the IPAM model — different IPSpaces can hold the same IP range)
- The poller attempts to match each ARP entry to the correct IPSpace based on the VRF name (configurable mapping: `DeviceVRFMapping`: `device_id`, `vrf_name`, `ip_space_id`)

### IP/MAC/Port Display

In the IP address list, additional columns show:
- **MAC Vendor** (from OUI lookup)
- **Switch** (which device last reported this MAC in its FDB)
- **Port** (which interface on that switch)

Example row:
```
10.0.1.42 | db-01.corp.example.com | 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E (Dell) | sw-01.dc1 | Gi1/0/24 | Allocated
```

## 13a. DNSBL / RBL Reputation Monitoring (#528)

SpatiumDDI already knows every public-facing IP it manages, so it can
check them against the major DNS blocklists before a
mail-deliverability / reputation problem is reported by users. IPv4
only in v1 (the DNSBLs are IPv4-centric; IPv6 DNSBL is a future
enhancement).

Behind the **`security.dnsbl`** feature module, which ships **disabled**
([#1069](https://github.com/spatiumnorth/spatiumddi/issues/1069)): armed, it
asks public blocklist operators about the operator's own address space, and
an off-prem call is a choice. It is the outer of two gates — even enabled,
the subsystem makes **zero external DNS queries** until the operator flips
the master sweep switch AND enables at least one list.

**Curated catalog** (`dnsbl_list`). Seeded as platform rows
(`is_builtin=True`) at startup, keyed on the unique `zone_suffix`
(idempotent; refreshes descriptive metadata but never clobbers the
operator-owned `enabled` flag). Seeded lists: Spamhaus ZEN
(`zen.spamhaus.org`), Barracuda (`b.barracudacentral.org`), SpamCop
(`bl.spamcop.net`), SORBS (`dnsbl.sorbs.net`), UCEPROTECT L1
(`dnsbl-1.uceprotect.net`), PSBL (`psbl.surriel.com`). Each row carries
a `return_codes` map (127.0.0.x → meaning), `requires_registration`,
and a `qps_note` describing the list's query-rate / registration policy
— surfaced as a badge + note in the setup UI. Every list ships
**disabled**; the operator opts each in after reading its policy
(Spamhaus / Barracuda need a data-feed subscription or a registered,
non-public resolver for anything beyond trivial volume). Operators can
also add custom lists; built-in rows can be disabled but not deleted.

**Candidate set.** The daily sweep derives its candidate IPs from four
sources (deduped; private/reserved/CGNAT and IPv6 skipped via
`app.services.ipam.classify.is_private_ip`; source precedence
pinned > nat_egress > internet_facing > ipam):
- public IPv4 IPAM `ip_address` rows;
- every IP in an `internet_facing`-classified subnet (#75);
- NAT / hide-NAT / PAT external (egress) addresses (`nat_mapping.external_ip`);
- operator-pinned IPs (`dnsbl_pinned_ip`).

**Sweep** (`app.tasks.dnsbl_sweep.sweep_dnsbl`, beat daily at 04:30).
Gated inside the task on the `security.dnsbl` module + the
`PlatformSettings.dnsbl_monitoring_enabled` master switch. For each
candidate × enabled list it issues a reversed-octet lookup
(`4.3.2.1.zen.spamhaus.org`, A + TXT) via dnspython's async resolver,
jitter-throttled to stay list-friendly, `autoretry_for` transient
DB/socket errors. NXDOMAIN = not listed; an A answer = listed (TXT
fetched for the delist reason). A resolver error is recorded as
`check_error` and never flips a listing off (so a transient failure
can't spuriously auto-resolve an alert). Per-`(ip, list)` latch state
persists to `dnsbl_listing` (`listed`, `return_codes`, `txt_reason`,
`first_listed_at`, `last_checked_at`, `resolved_at`). Optional explicit
resolver IPs via `dnsbl_query_resolvers` (some lists refuse queries
from large public resolvers).

**Alert.** The latch-once `ip_blocklisted` AlertRule (seeded DISABLED)
fires on first listing (naming the lists) and auto-resolves when the
sweep finds the IP delisted, via the standard AlertEvent →
syslog/webhook/SMTP/chat fan-out.

**Surfaces.** Admin page at **Administration → DNS Blocklists**
(`/admin/dns-blocklists`): sweep settings, per-list enable +
registration/QPS notes, pinned-IPs list, blocklisted-IP overview. The
IP detail modal (IPAM row-click) grows a **Reputation** panel showing
per-list status + a manual **Check now** action
(`POST /dnsbl/check`). REST under `/api/v1/dnsbl/*`; Operator Copilot
tools `find_blocklisted_ips` / `count_blocklisted_ips` /
`find_dnsbl_lists` (read, default-on) + `propose_pin_ip_for_dnsbl`
(write proposal, default-off).

## 14. UI Backlog (Tracked Items)

Items marked ✅ are implemented. Remaining items are planned but not yet built.

### ✅ 14.1 Network and Broadcast Address Display

**Implemented.** When a subnet is created, `network` and `broadcast` address records are automatically inserted. They appear in the IP address table with distinct grey `network` / `broadcast` status badges, are rendered at reduced opacity, have no edit or delete buttons, and are excluded from allocation (next-available and manual). `/31` and `/32` subnets are exempt per RFC 3021.

### ✅ 14.2 Inline Editing of IP Spaces, Subnets, and IP Addresses

**Implemented.**
- **IP Space**: pencil icon on space header → edit modal (name, description). Delete is accessible from within the edit modal via a two-step confirmation (warning → checkbox confirm).
- **Subnet**: pencil icon on subnet row (hover) and in detail panel header → edit modal (name, description, gateway, VLAN ID, status).
- **IP Address**: pencil icon on each address row → edit modal (hostname, description, MAC, status). `network` and `broadcast` rows are not editable.

### ✅ 14.3 Space Tree-Table View

**Implemented.** Clicking an IP Space in the left tree now shows a hierarchical flat table in the right panel. The table renders all blocks and subnets in the space in order, with depth-based indentation showing the tree structure. Block rows use a violet `Layers` icon and appear with a subtle background; subnet rows use a blue `Network` icon. Columns: Network, Name, VLAN, Used IPs, Utilization bar, Size (total IPs), Status. Clicking a block row navigates to `BlockDetailView`; clicking a subnet row opens the subnet IP address list.

### ✅ 14.4 Blocks vs Subnets Distinction in Create Flow

**Implemented.** Separate "Add block" (Layers icon) and "Add subnet" (+ icon) buttons appear on the space header and on each block row. `CreateBlockModal` has no gateway/VLAN/DHCP fields. Blocks appear with a `Layers` icon; subnets with a `Network` icon throughout the tree and table views.

### ✅ 14.5 Breadcrumbs as Colored Pills

**Implemented.** A `BreadcrumbPills` component renders clickable colored pills above all detail panels:
- **Blue pill** = IP Space (navigates to space tree-table)
- **Violet pill** = Block or ancestor blocks (navigates to `BlockDetailView`)
- **Emerald pill** = current Subnet (non-interactive, marks current position)

When the path is deeper than 4 levels, middle items are compressed to `…`. Pills appear in `SubnetDetail`, `BlockDetailView`, and `SpaceTableView`.

### ✅ 14.6 Collapsible Left Sidebar

**Implemented.** A `«` / `»` chevron button at the sidebar footer collapses the sidebar to 56px icon-only mode. Nav items show tooltips on hover when collapsed. State is persisted to `localStorage` and restored on page load.

### 14.7 Settings Page Link

A **Settings** entry should be added to the left sidebar nav, pointing to `/settings`. Phase 1 settings include:
- Platform display name and logo
- Default IP allocation strategy (sequential / random)
- Session timeout
- Utilization warning / critical thresholds
- Auto-logout idle timeout

This maps to the `PlatformSettings` singleton model defined in `SYSTEM_ADMIN.md §6`.

### ✅ 14.8 Orphaned (Soft-Deleted) IP Addresses

**Implemented** (using status field rather than `deleted_at`). When an IP address is deleted via the UI, `DELETE /ipam/addresses/{id}` sets `status = "orphan"` rather than issuing a SQL DELETE. Orphaned addresses:
- Appear in the IP list at reduced opacity with an orange "orphan" status badge
- Show a **Restore** (RefreshCw) button that sets status back to `allocated`
- Show a **Purge** (Trash) button that permanently deletes after a confirmation modal
- `DELETE /ipam/addresses/{id}?permanent=true` hard-deletes immediately

Note: the current implementation uses `status = "orphan"` instead of a `deleted_at` column. The spec's "Show deleted toggle" and "recycle bin" concept can be revisited in a future density pass.

### ✅ 14.9 IP Space Table View (Click-Through)

**Implemented.** See §14.3 above. The space view now shows a hierarchical tree-table with both blocks and subnets, not just subnets.

---

## 15. Post-Alpha Additions (Unreleased)

Features that landed after the `2026.04.16-2` cut but before the next tag.

### ✅ 15.1 Block / Subnet Overlap Validation

`_assert_no_block_overlap()` in `backend/app/api/v1/ipam/router.py` rejects
two failure modes at create time and on the reparent path of
`update_block`:
- **Same-level duplicates** — creating `10.0.0.0/8` twice under the same
  parent (or at the space root) fails with `409 Conflict`.
- **Overlapping CIDRs** — creating `10.0.0.0/16` when a sibling
  `10.0.0.0/8` already exists at the same level fails with the same status.

Implementation is a single PostgreSQL query using the `cidr &&` operator:

```sql
SELECT network FROM ip_block
WHERE space_id = :space_id
  AND network && CAST(:network AS cidr)
  AND (parent_block_id IS NOT DISTINCT FROM :parent_block_id)
  AND (:exclude_id IS NULL OR id <> :exclude_id)
```

Subnet overlap within a parent block is already enforced by existing
`Subnet` validation.

### ✅ 15.2 Scheduled IPAM ↔ DNS Auto-Sync

Celery beat task `app.tasks.ipam_dns_sync.auto_sync_ipam_dns` runs every
60 s unconditionally; the task itself gates on three `PlatformSettings`
columns:
- `dns_auto_sync_enabled` — master on/off (default off).
- `dns_auto_sync_interval_minutes` — how often the task actually syncs
  (default 30 min). The task last-run timestamp is persisted so the
  cadence can be changed from the Settings UI without restarting beat.
- `dns_auto_sync_delete_stale` — opt-in deletion of auto-generated DNS
  records that no longer match an IPAM row.

The task iterates every subnet with `dns_zone_id` set and delegates the
per-subnet reconciliation to
`app.services.dns.sync_check.compute_subnet_dns_drift` +
`app.api.v1.ipam.router._apply_dns_sync` — the same code paths that power
the manual "Sync now" button, so results are identical.

Admin UI: new **DNS Auto-Sync** section in `/admin/settings` with
enable-toggle, interval input, and delete-stale checkbox.

### ✅ 15.3 Shared Zone Picker + Bulk-Edit DNS Zone

`ZoneOptions` is a shared React component that renders a DNS-zone
`<select>` dropdown with the subnet's primary zone first and an
`<optgroup label="Additional zones">` separator for the rest. Used in:

- **Allocate IP** modal (CreateAddressModal).
- **Edit IP** modal (EditAddressModal).
- **Bulk-edit IPs** modal (when the "DNS zone" opt-in toggle is enabled).

The picker is restricted to the subnet's explicit primary + additional
zones when any are pinned. If the subnet only has a DNS group assigned
(no per-zone pinning), the picker falls back to every forward zone in the
group (reverse zones are filtered out).

`IPAddressBulkChanges.dns_zone_id` on
`POST /api/v1/ipam/addresses/bulk-edit` routes each selected IP through
`_sync_dns_record` for move / create / delete, so bulk re-homing an IP
range to a different zone updates DNS in the same request.

### ✅ 15.4 Bulk-Edit per-field opt-in

Every field on the bulk-edit-IPs modal has a sibling checkbox. Unchecked
fields are left untouched for every selected row; checked fields are
applied. Tags support both a **merge** mode (union with existing) and a
**replace-all** mode selected via a radio underneath the tags input. This
replaces the earlier behaviour where any modified field applied to every
selected row regardless of intent.

### ✅ 15.5 Inherited-Field Placeholders

`EditSubnetModal` and `EditBlockModal` show every custom-field input with
an HTML `placeholder` sourced from the first ancestor that defines the
field. A small "inherited from block `<name>`" or "inherited from space
`<name>`" badge appears next to the input. Typing a value overrides the
inheritance; clearing the input restores it.

Backed by:
- `GET /api/v1/ipam/subnets/{id}/effective-fields` (existing).
- `GET /api/v1/ipam/blocks/{id}/effective-fields` (new — parity endpoint
  added in Wave D).

### ✅ 15.6 IPv6 Support

Storage, allocation, and the UI paths support IPv6 today. Specifically:

- `Subnet.total_ips` widened to `BigInteger` (migration `e3c7b91f2a45`)
  so a `/64` (`2⁶⁴` addresses) fits; `_total_ips()` clamps at `2⁶³ − 1`
  for anything larger.
- `DHCPScope.address_family` column (migration `d7a2b6e9f134`). The Kea
  driver renders either a `Dhcp4` or `Dhcp6` config block from the same
  scope rows, with v6 option-name translation via `_KEA_OPTION_NAMES_V6`
  (v4-only options are dropped from v6 scopes with a warning).
- Subnet create skips the v6 broadcast row; `_sync_dns_record` emits AAAA
  forward records + PTR in `ip6.arpa` reverse zones.
- `GET /api/v1/ipam/blocks/{id}/available-subnets` accepts `/8`–`/128`
  with an address-family guard; the frontend's "Find by size" splits the
  prefix pool into v4 (`/8–/32`) and v6 (`/32, /40, /44, /48, /52, /56,
  /60, /64, /72, /80, /96, /112, /120, /124, /127, /128`) and filters to
  prefixes strictly longer than the selected block's prefix.
- Create-block and create-subnet placeholder text includes an IPv6
  example (`e.g. 10.0.0.0/8 or 2001:db8::/32`).
- Next-available allocation works on v6 subnets: `POST /api/v1/ipam/subnets/{id}/next`
  honours `sequential` / `random` / `eui64` strategies, defaulting to
  `Subnet.ipv6_allocation_policy`. EUI-64 derives per RFC 4291 §2.5.1
  (`_eui64_from_mac`); random uses a CSPRNG suffix with collision retry
  and skips the all-zero subnet-router anycast address. `_pick_next_available_ip`
  drives both the commit path and `GET /api/v1/ipam/subnets/{id}/next-ip-preview`
  (which accepts `?mac_address=` to preview the EUI-64 candidate). Unit
  coverage lives in `backend/tests/test_ipv6_allocation.py`, pinning the
  RFC 4291 Appendix A worked example.

### ✅ 15.7 IP Alias Refresh + Delete Confirmation

Two smaller UX fixes on the subnet **Aliases** tab:

- Adding or deleting an alias from the IP Edit modal now invalidates
  `["subnet-aliases", subnet_id]` in addition to the per-IP cache, so
  switching tabs no longer shows a stale alias list.
- The trash icon in the subnet Aliases tab now pops a
  `ConfirmDeleteModal` ("Delete alias `<fqdn>`? The DNS record will be
  removed.") — matching the single-step confirmation used elsewhere in
  IPAM rather than firing an unconfirmed delete.

### ✅ 15.8 Modal Focus-Ring Fix

IPAM form inputs now use `focus:ring-inset` so the 2px focus ring renders
inside the rounded border. Prevents the left / right edges of the ring
from being clipped by the modal wrapper's `overflow-y-auto`, which
browsers treat as `overflow-x: auto` in practice.

### ✅ 15.9 Mobile-Responsive Layout

- Sidebar converts to a drawer with a backdrop at `<md` breakpoints; a
  hamburger toggle appears in the `Header` component.
- All data tables in IPAM / DNS / DHCP / VLANs / admin are wrapped in
  `overflow-x-auto` with a `min-w` so wide columns scroll horizontally
  instead of overflowing the viewport.
- All modals use `max-w-[95vw]` on `<sm` so they always fit the screen.

### ✅ 15.10 Subnet / Block Resize (grow-only)

**Why this and not arbitrary CIDR edit.** A network engineer's source of
truth is the CIDR stored in SpatiumDDI. A bad edit silently orphans IP
records, breaks DHCP scopes, and invalidates reverse-zone coverage.
Resize is a **restricted, validated, audited** operation with two
explicit guarantees:

1. The new CIDR is strictly **larger** than the old (smaller prefix
   length). Shrinking is rejected with a 422 that explains the workflow
   (delete + recreate is the safer path).
2. The old CIDR is a **sub-network** of the new CIDR (``old.subnet_of(new)``
   in Python ``ipaddress`` semantics). A "resize" that would move the
   network address to an entirely different range is really a recreate
   and is rejected.

**Endpoints** (under the standard IPAM router-level permission gate —
POST requires ``write`` on subnet / ip_block):

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/ipam/subnets/{id}/resize/preview` | Blast-radius dry-run |
| POST | `/api/v1/ipam/subnets/{id}/resize` | Commit under advisory lock |
| POST | `/api/v1/ipam/blocks/{id}/resize/preview` | Same for blocks |
| POST | `/api/v1/ipam/blocks/{id}/resize` | Same for blocks |

**Validation rules** (every rule re-run at commit time — TOCTOU guard):

- Grow-only, same address family (v4 ↔ v6 is a recreate, not a resize).
- Old CIDR ⊂ new CIDR.
- New CIDR must fit inside the **parent block** (for subnets) or **parent
  block** (for child blocks). If the parent is too small we return 422
  with "resize the parent block first" — we do **not** chain-resize the
  parent. A silent recursive resize is how a network tree gets a hole
  punched through it.
- No overlap with siblings or cousins anywhere in the same ``IPSpace``.
- Block resize: every descendant block + subnet must still fit inside
  the new CIDR. Mathematically redundant given rule 2 but re-checked.
- ``space_id`` is invariant — resize never moves a resource across spaces.

**Preview response** (``SubnetResizePreviewResponse``) surfaces the
"blast radius" so the operator knows what they're about to touch:

- Old vs. new network / broadcast IPs + total IP count delta.
- Current gateway + suggested new first-usable (caller decides whether
  to move it).
- Placeholders split into two buckets:
  - ``placeholders_default_named`` — the ``network`` / ``broadcast`` rows
    with no user-set hostname. These are the rows the commit can safely
    recycle to the new boundaries.
  - ``placeholders_renamed`` — rows at old boundaries where the user has
    set a hostname (e.g. ``anycast-vip``). **Always preserved**; the
    commit never touches them regardless of
    ``replace_default_placeholders``.
- Affected counts: IPs in subnet, DHCP scopes / pools / static
  assignments, auto-generated DNS records, active leases.
- Reverse zones: which already exist for the old CIDR, which will be
  created for the new CIDR (``ensure_reverse_zone_for_subnet`` is
  called idempotently on commit).
- ``conflicts`` — non-empty means the commit will 4xx; the UI disables
  the confirm button.
- ``warnings`` — non-blocking items (DHCP pools won't auto-expand, the
  netmask change, and for any network-address shift a dedicated "update
  your ACLs / router docs" reminder).

**Commit request** (``SubnetResizeCommitRequest``):

| Field | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| ``new_cidr`` | *required* | The target CIDR. |
| ``move_gateway_to_first_usable`` | ``false`` | If true, set gateway to the new first-usable IP (``new_net.network_address + 1`` for v4 ≤/30, v6 ≤/126). Otherwise leave gateway untouched — the old gateway IP is guaranteed to be inside the new CIDR because old ⊂ new. |
| ``replace_default_placeholders`` | ``true`` | Delete the unchanged "network"/"broadcast" rows at the old boundaries and re-create them at the new boundaries. Renamed rows are preserved regardless. |

**Concurrency.** Commit wraps the full mutation in
``pg_try_advisory_xact_lock(ns, crc32(id))``; a concurrent resize on the
same resource returns **423 Locked**. The preview does *not* take the
lock — it is read-only and would only serialise legitimate parallel
read load.

**Audit.** One ``AuditLog(action="resize")`` row per commit, with
``old_value`` ``{network, gateway, total_ips}`` and ``new_value``
``{network, gateway, total_ips, reason: "user_resize",
placeholders_deleted, placeholders_created, dhcp_servers_notified}``,
and ``resource_display`` ``"{old_cidr} → {new_cidr}"``.

**DHCP / DNS side-effects.**

- For every agent-based DHCP server with a scope on the resized subnet,
  the control plane rebuilds the ``ConfigBundle``, bumps
  ``config_etag``, and enqueues a pending ``apply_config`` op (mirroring
  the subnet-delete path). Agentless drivers (Windows DHCP read-only)
  are skipped — they have no write surface.
- ``ensure_reverse_zone_for_subnet`` runs after the CIDR mutation so any
  new reverse-zone coverage is created. Idempotent when the zone
  already exists.
- Forward A/AAAA and PTR records for IPs inside the old CIDR are *not*
  touched — their values and names are unchanged by a grow.

**UI.** A new **Resize…** button sits next to **Edit** on both the
subnet header (``IPAMPage.tsx`` subnet detail) and the block header.
The modal (``frontend/src/pages/ipam/ResizeModals.tsx``) runs a
preview → confirm flow with:
- Live preview of old → new network / broadcast / gateway / IP count.
- Collapsible lists of affected DHCP scopes / DNS records / leases.
- A big yellow banner reminding the operator that clients, routers,
  and documentation outside SpatiumDDI need to be updated by hand.
- A **type-to-confirm** gate: the confirm button only enables after the
  user has typed the new CIDR exactly into a text input. Conflicts
  surfaced by the preview hide the confirm button entirely; there is
  no force-commit.

**Out of scope** (deliberate non-goals):

- Shrinking — explicit 422 rejection with guidance.
- Cross-space moves — rejected; space is invariant.
- Chain-resizing parent blocks — rejected; the operator must resize the
  parent first.
- Auto-expanding DHCP pools into the new address space — pools stay
  where they are; the preview flags this as a warning.
- DNS record value mutations — a grow doesn't change any record's
  ``name``/``value``; only new reverse-zone coverage is backfilled.

### ✅ 15.11 IP Assignment Collision Warnings

Two non-fatal guardrails on IP create / update. Both fire at the API
layer (so Terraform, Ansible, and ad-hoc scripts get the same
treatment as the UI); both are confirmable — they're warnings, not
hard rejections. The user's options either way are "fix the input" or
"do it anyway".

| Collision | Trigger |
|---|---|
| **FQDN** | Same ``(lower(hostname), forward_zone_id)`` on another IP anywhere in SpatiumDDI. Common accident: two people naming a host ``web``. Occasionally deliberate: round-robin A records. |
| **MAC** | Same normalised MAC anywhere in IPAM. Usually means the MAC was cloned / moved and the old row should be decommissioned before re-use. |

**Server side.** ``_normalize_mac`` canonicalises colons / dashes /
dots / bare-hex input to 12 lowercase hex chars before comparison so
``AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`` and ``aabb.ccdd.eeff`` collide as expected.
``_check_ip_collisions`` joins through ``DNSZone`` + ``Subnet`` to
return a list of warning dicts with the existing IP, subnet, and
(for FQDN collisions) the published FQDN.

A ``force: bool = False`` field is added to ``IPAddressCreate`` /
``IPAddressUpdate`` / ``NextIPRequest``. When ``force=false`` and a
collision exists the endpoint returns **409** with
``detail = {warnings: [...], requires_confirmation: true}``. Clients
re-submit with ``force=true`` to proceed.

On update, the check only runs for fields the client explicitly set
(``model_dump(exclude_unset=True)``), so editing an unrelated field
on an IP that happens to share an FQDN with another row won't surface
a warning. ``exclude_ip_id=ip.id`` keeps the row from colliding with
its own current state.

**UI.** Shared ``CollisionWarning`` type + amber
``CollisionWarningBanner`` in ``IPAMPage.tsx``. Both the allocate and
edit modals parse the 409 body, render one line per collision (FQDN +
existing IP + subnet, or MAC + existing IP + hostname + subnet), and
flip the submit button to "Allocate anyway" / "Save anyway". Editing
any collision-relevant field clears the pending warning so the next
submit re-checks fresh.

**What's intentionally not a collision.**

- Same FQDN in different zones (e.g. ``web.corp.example.com`` vs.
  ``web.staging.example.com``) — those are distinct records.
- PTR collisions — every IP gets at most one PTR, handled separately
  by the Sync DNS classifier.
- Empty MAC / empty hostname — nothing to collide with.

### ✅ 15.12 DHCP Pool Awareness in IP Listing & Allocation

The subnet IP listing now shows **where DHCP pools begin and end**,
and the allocation paths refuse to hand out IPs that live inside a
**dynamic** pool — those are owned by the DHCP server, not IPAM.

**IP listing.** The subnet table renders ▼ "Start of ``<type>`` pool"
and ▲ "End of ``<type>`` pool" rows interleaved with the IP rows,
computed client-side from the pool ranges. Colour by pool type:

| Pool type | Accent | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| ``dynamic`` | cyan | DHCP server hands these out first-come-first-served |
| ``reserved`` | violet | Reserved for future static allocation |
| ``excluded`` | zinc | Carved out of the dynamic range — operator may manually allocate |

Pool markers render even when no IPs have been assigned inside the
range, so the operator sees pool extents as first-class structure.

**Backend gates.** Three helpers in ``backend/app/api/v1/ipam/router.py``:

- ``_load_dynamic_pool_ranges(db, subnet_id)`` joins
  ``DHCPPool → DHCPScope → Subnet`` and returns packed int ranges
  for every ``pool_type == "dynamic"`` pool on the subnet.
- ``_ip_int_in_dynamic_pool(ip_int, ranges)`` — cheap contains check
  used by both the write path and the preview endpoint.
- ``_pick_next_available_ip(db, subnet, strategy)`` — hoisted out of
  ``allocate_next_ip`` so the commit path and the new preview
  endpoint share the same "skip dynamic ranges" semantics.

**Allocation rules.**

| Path | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| ``POST /subnets/{id}/addresses`` (manual) | Allowed inside a dynamic pool, but returns a **force-overridable collision warning** (`409` with `{warnings, requires_confirmation}`, `kind: "dynamic_pool"`) so the operator confirms and knows to also pin a matching static reservation (#631). Excluded / reserved pools raise no warning. |
| ``POST /subnets/{id}/next`` | ``_pick_next_available_ip`` skips dynamic ranges during its linear search. |
| ``GET  /subnets/{id}/next-ip-preview?strategy=sequential\|random`` | Read-only peek. Returns ``{address, strategy}``; ``address: null`` means IPv6 (not supported) or exhausted subnet. No lock, no write. |

**UI.** ``AddAddressModal`` in **next** mode fetches the preview on
open and shows ``Next available: 10.0.1.42 (skips dynamic DHCP
pools)`` as an emerald highlight, or a destructive "No free IPs in
this subnet" line with submit disabled when the subnet is exhausted.
In **manual** mode the typed address is checked client-side against
the dynamic ranges: an inline red warning renders + the submit button
disables. The server-side 422 is still the authoritative check — the
client check is just a better round-trip.

### ✅ 15.13 Subnet-Scoped IP Address Import

The space-scoped importer (§7) creates blocks + subnets from a
vendor export; it does not import *addresses*. The subnet-scoped
importer handles the far more common "dump IPs out of phpIPAM /
NetBox / Infoblox / a CSV and load them into SpatiumDDI" migration
case.

**Endpoints:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/ipam/import/addresses/preview` | Parse + dry-run validation |
| POST | `/api/v1/ipam/import/addresses/commit` | Apply with `fail` / `skip` / `overwrite` |

**Parser.** Auto-routes CSV / JSON / XLSX rows by header — ``address``
or ``ip`` columns make a row an **address**, ``network`` makes it a
**subnet** (rejected by the address importer; space-scoped importer
handles that case). Unrecognised columns drop into
``custom_fields`` so a raw vendor export works without rename passes.

**Validation per row.** Each IP must fall inside the targeted
subnet's CIDR. Rows outside are rejected at preview. The strategy
controls the collision behaviour when a row matches an existing IP
by ``(subnet_id, address)``:

| Strategy | On match |
|---|---|
| ``fail`` | Reject the whole batch (default). |
| ``skip`` | Leave the existing row untouched, count as skipped. |
| ``overwrite`` | Apply the import row's fields. |

**DNS sync.** Rows with a ``hostname`` route through
``_sync_dns_record(..., action="create")`` so A + PTR records publish
through the same RFC 2136 / WinRM path the UI uses. Reverse zones
are backfilled on commit.

**Audit.** One ``AuditLog(action="import")`` row per commit with
counts of created / updated / skipped / failed.

**UI.** ``AddressImportModal`` + a combined **Import / Export**
dropdown on the subnet header (`SubnetImportExportButton`) replacing
the older single-purpose export button.

### ✅ 15.14 Per-IP role + reservation TTL + MAC observation history

Three IP enrichment columns landed in `2026.04.26-1` via migration
`f1c9a4d2b8e6_ip_role_reserved_mac_history`:

- **`ip_address.role`** (string, nullable) — `host` / `loopback` /
  `anycast` / `vip` / `vrrp` / `secondary` / `gateway`. Orthogonal
  to `status` — a row can be both `allocated` and a `vip`.
  `IP_ROLES_SHARED` (`anycast`, `vip`, `vrrp`) bypass MAC-collision
  warnings, since the same MAC legitimately appears on multiple IPs
  in load-balancer or HSRP/VRRP topologies. Surfaced in the IP
  table as a chip and in the create/edit modal as a picker.

- **`ip_address.reserved_until`** (timestamp, nullable) — soft TTL
  on `status="reserved"` rows. The new beat task
  `app.tasks.ipam_reservation_sweep.sweep_expired_reservations`
  runs every 5 min, finds rows whose TTL has passed, and flips them
  back to `available`. UI shows a relative-time chip ("expires in
  2 days") on the row + a datetime picker in the edit modal.

- **`ip_mac_history`** table — append-only record of every distinct
  MAC ever observed against an IP, keyed
  `(ip_address_id, mac_address)` with `first_seen` + `last_seen`
  timestamps. Written on every IP create/update where a MAC is
  present; surfaced via `GET /ipam/addresses/{id}/mac-history`
  (newest-first, OUI vendor lookup attached). The IP detail toolbar
  gains a "MAC History" button that opens a modal listing the
  rows.

### ✅ 15.15 Subnet operations — find-free / split / merge

Three preview-then-commit endpoints, all with typed-CIDR
confirmation gates and pg advisory locks held through commit:

- `POST /ipam/spaces/{id}/find-free` — walks the IPBlock tree for
  unallocated CIDRs of the requested prefix length. Optional
  `parent_block_id` scope (Find Free… on the block detail
  pre-restricts to that block) and a `min_free_addresses` filter.
  Service layer in `app.services.ipam.free_space`.

- `POST /ipam/subnets/{id}/split/preview` + `/commit` — break a
  subnet into 2^k aligned children at a longer prefix. Preview
  reports the prospective children + any IP-address conflicts
  (rows that wouldn't fit cleanly into one child or the other);
  commit refuses if the typed CIDR doesn't match. Service in
  `app.services.ipam.subnet_split`.

- `POST /ipam/subnets/{id}/merge/preview` + `/commit` — collapse
  contiguous siblings back into one supernet via
  `ipaddress.collapse_addresses`. Preview reports the prospective
  merged CIDR + any conflicts. Single-source gateways are
  preserved; differing source gateways are nulled (operator must
  re-set). Service in `app.services.ipam.subnet_merge`.

UI surfaces all three on the subnet-detail header, *and* via the
bulk-action toolbar on the block- and space-level subnet tables:
select 1 subnet to enable Split, select 2+ to enable Merge.
Free-space finder on the block detail header pre-scopes to the
block.

### ✅ 15.16 Soft-delete + Trash recovery

IPSpace, IPBlock, Subnet, DNSZone, DNSRecord, DHCPScope, and — since
#617 — a scope's DHCPPool and DHCPStaticAssignment children (which
ride the scope's `deletion_batch_id`, so one Restore brings the scope
back whole) inherit `SoftDeleteMixin` (`deleted_at`,
`deleted_by_user_id`, `deletion_batch_id`). A global `do_orm_execute`
listener injects
`deleted_at IS NULL` into every SELECT — opt out via
`execution_options(include_deleted=True)`. Cascade-stamping under
one `deletion_batch_id` lets a single Restore click bring back
every dependent row atomically (subnet → its DHCP scopes; zone →
its records).

- Subnet / block / space delete is soft by default — UI confirms
  "move to Trash. You can restore from Admin → Trash within 30
  days." Hard-delete is reachable via the Permanent button on the
  Trash row.
- IP addresses are deliberately NOT soft-deletable — they
  cascade-delete with their parent subnet, and the parent subnet
  is the recoverable unit.
- Nightly `app.tasks.trash_purge.purge_expired_soft_deletes`
  hard-deletes rows past `PlatformSettings.soft_delete_purge_days`
  (default 30; set to 0 to keep forever).
- Admin UI at `/admin/trash` lists deleted rows newest-first,
  per-type filter + since-date filter + free-text search.
  Restore button opens a confirmation modal that surfaces conflict
  details when a live row would clash on the same uniqueness key.

Migration `c1f4a8b27d09_soft_delete`.

### ✅ 15.17 IPSpace VRF / route-domain annotation

Three new optional columns on `ip_space` (migration
`f1c8b2a945d3_subnet_ops_ipspace_vrf`):

- `vrf_name` — VARCHAR(64), nullable.
- `route_distinguisher` — VARCHAR(32), nullable. ASN:idx or
  IPv4:idx form; no validation since vendors disagree.
- `route_targets` — JSONB list of RT strings (`[]` is a legal
  value distinct from NULL).

Pure metadata — address allocation already supports overlapping
ranges via separate IPSpace rows; these columns give operators
somewhere to put the routing identity for reporting / export /
future BGP-EVPN integration. Surfaced as badges on the IPSpace
detail header when set, plus a "VRF / Routing" section in the
Edit Space modal (open by default since operators kept missing
it under a collapsed toggle).

### ✅ 15.18 NAT mapping cross-reference into IPAM

`nat_mapping` carries operator-curated 1:1 NAT, PAT, and hide-NAT
records. SpatiumDDI doesn't render or push these rules — purely
IPAM cross-reference. Migration `f5b9c1e8d472_nat_ip_fks` adds
optional FK columns `internal_ip_address_id` +
`external_ip_address_id` (`ON DELETE SET NULL`) auto-resolved on
create / update by looking up the typed string in `ip_address`.
Strings stay authoritative for addresses outside IPAM (a public
WAN IP, a peer's NAT endpoint).

- **Conflict detection** — create / update rejects 409 when an
  external IP+ports is already claimed by another `1to1` / `pat`
  rule on the same protocol (port-overlap aware, protocol-aware).
- **Per-IP listing** — `GET /ipam/nat-mappings/by-ip/{id}` returns
  every mapping touching an IPAM row (FK match + INET-string match
  on either side).
- **Per-subnet listing** — `GET /ipam/nat-mappings/by-subnet/{id}`
  uses Postgres `inet <<= cidr` containment to find every mapping
  whose internal IP falls inside a subnet's CIDR.

UI: clicking the NAT badge on an IP row opens a modal listing
every mapping for that IP; new "NAT" tab on the subnet detail
shows every mapping touching the subnet's CIDR.

### ✅ 15.19 VXLAN ID surface in the UI

`subnet.vxlan_id` (Integer, range 1–16 777 214, nullable) existed
in the schema and the frontend type but no UI ever read or wrote
it. Numeric input added to Create + Edit subnet modals next to the
VLAN picker; chip on the subnet detail header next to the existing
VLAN chip when set.

### ✅ 15.20 IPAM template classes (issue #26)

Reusable stamp templates for blocks + subnets. New `ipam_template`
table captures default tags / custom-fields / DNS / DHCP / DDNS
settings (plus an optional sub-subnet `child_layout`) and stamps
them onto blocks or subnets at apply time. ``applies_to`` locks
each template to one of the two carriers so apply-time semantics
stay unambiguous. ``force=False`` fills only empty/null target
columns; ``force=True`` overwrites unconditionally and is the path
``/reapply-all`` uses to refresh drift across every recorded
instance (cap 200). ``IPBlockCreate.template_id`` /
``SubnetCreate.template_id`` add optional pre-fill on the create
paths; carrier rows now carry an ``applied_template_id`` SET-NULL
FK so a "reapply across instances" sweep can find every row touched.
Block templates with ``child_layout`` carve sub-subnets sequentially
on apply (and on create); idempotent — sub-subnets already at a
target CIDR are skipped. Admin → Platform → IPAM Templates page
with list + tabbed editor (General / Tags + CFs + DNS-DHCP / DDNS /
Child layout). New `manage_ipam_templates` permission seeded into
the IPAM Editor builtin role.

### ✅ 15.21 Block move across IP spaces (issue #27)

`POST /ipam/blocks/{id}/move/preview` + `/move/commit` accept a
target `space_id` + a typed-name confirmation. Pre-flight validates
target space exists, no CIDR overlap in the target tree, every
dependent row (DNS records, DHCP scopes, addresses with custom-field inheritance)
survives the move. `MoveBlockModal` walks the operator through
the consequences with a chevron-revealed list of affected resources
before the typed-name confirm unlocks Move.

### ✅ 15.22 Subnet classification tags (issue #75)

Four boolean columns on `subnet` for compliance flags:
`pci_scope`, `hipaa_scope`, `internet_facing`, `contains_pii`.
Tags inherit through the IP block tree (set on a parent block →
all descendant subnets get the tag) with an explicit override
toggle on the subnet. List filters across the IPAM page + the API.
Compliance card on Platform Insights shows rolled-up counts.

### ✅ 15.23 Split-horizon DNS publishing at the IPAM layer (issue #25)

`IPBlock.dns_split_horizon` boolean + the existing
`dns_inherit_settings` walk. When set, descendant subnets publish
records to `dns_zone_id` (internal) AND every entry in
`dns_additional_zone_ids` (DMZ / external). Per-record routing is
decided by the new `IPAddress.dns_zone_overrides` JSONB list
(`[{zone_id, record_type}]`) so an operator can pin one address to
publish only into the internal zone. Auto-sync task respects the
split. Closes the IPAM-layer half of the split-horizon roadmap;
DNS Views (#24) covers the recursive-resolver-side split.

## 16. Rules & constraints

Server-side validations that reject requests with a human-readable
error. Clients should surface the response `detail` — the IPAM UI
already wires this up for every delete / allocate / create flow.

### Delete guards

- **IP space delete refused when non-empty.** A space with any blocks
  or subnets can't be dropped; clear them first. `409` in
  `backend/app/api/v1/ipam/router.py`.
- **Block delete refused when non-empty.** A block with child blocks
  *or* subnets returns `409` with a breakdown (*"Block 10.0.0.0/8
  still contains 3 child block(s) and 5 subnet(s)"*).
  `backend/app/api/v1/ipam/router.py`.
- **Subnet delete refused when non-empty.** A subnet with user-owned
  IPs (anything other than `network`, `broadcast`, `orphan`, or
  DHCP-lease-mirrored `auto_from_lease` rows) or any DHCP scope
  attached is rejected with `409`. Pass `?force=true` to cascade;
  the same pre-delete cleanup (WinRM remove-scope, Kea bundle
  rebuild) still runs so nothing is orphaned on a running server.
  `backend/app/api/v1/ipam/router.py`.

### Block hierarchy

- **Block cannot be its own parent.** `parent_block_id` must not
  equal the block's own id. `422` in
  `backend/app/api/v1/ipam/router.py`.
- **Reparenting can't create a cycle.** Moving a block into one of
  its own descendants is caught before commit; same rule applies via
  drag-and-drop in the UI (checked client-side too, but the server
  is authoritative). `422`.
- **Block must fit inside its parent block.** Child CIDR must be
  fully contained in the parent's CIDR. Enforced on create + on
  reparent. `422`.
- **Block overlap at the same level.** Sibling blocks in the same
  space cannot have overlapping CIDRs (duplicates or otherwise).
  Checked via `_assert_no_block_overlap`. `422`.

### Subnets

- **Subnet must fit inside its parent block.** `422`.
- **Subnet overlap within a space.** Two subnets in the same IP space
  cannot overlap, regardless of which block they sit under. Checked
  via `_assert_no_overlap`. `422`.
- **Gateway must be a valid IP inside the subnet.** Malformed IPs
  return `422`; a parseable IP outside the CIDR returns `422`.
- **VLAN reference must resolve.** A `vlan_ref_id` that doesn't
  point to an existing VLAN returns `404`.
- **VLAN ID must match the referenced VLAN.** If both `vlan_id` and
  `vlan_ref_id` are supplied, the tag must match the referenced
  VLAN's tag. `422`.

### IP allocation

- **IP must be inside the subnet's CIDR.** `422`. Same
  check applies in the import path.
- **IP inside a dynamic DHCP pool is a soft warning (#631).** Manual
  allocation inside an active `dynamic` pool is *allowed* — pinning a
  MAC in-range is the standard idiom on every driver we ship — but
  returns a force-overridable collision warning (`409`,
  `kind: "dynamic_pool"`) reminding the operator to also create a
  matching static reservation on the scope, since a bare IPAM row does
  not itself stop the DHCP server leasing the address. Re-submit with
  `force=true` to proceed. Auto-allocation (`next` / `next-ip-preview`
  / bulk) still *skips* dynamic ranges — only the explicit, typed path
  opens up.
- **IP already allocated in the subnet.** Duplicate address in the
  same subnet returns `409`.
- **Malformed IP.** Non-parseable address in create / import paths
  returns `422`.
- **`static_dhcp` status requires a MAC.** Creating an IP with
  `status="static_dhcp"` without a `mac_address` is rejected — a
  static reservation needs something to match on. `422`.
- **Collision warnings are soft, not hard.** Duplicate hostname +
  forward zone, or duplicate MAC across subnets, returns `409` with
  `{"warnings": [...], "requires_confirmation": True}`; the client
  can retry with `force=true` to override. Unlike the rules above,
  this one isn't a permanent block.

### Enum validators

Pydantic field validators — all return `422` with the offending
value and the allowed set. Kept compact because the error messages
speak for themselves.

- `IPSpace.color` → `VALID_SPACE_COLORS` (same 8 swatches as zone
  colour). `backend/app/api/v1/ipam/router.py`.
- `Subnet.status` → allowed set (`active`, `deprecated`, etc).
- `Subnet.ddns_hostname_policy` → see `docs/features/DHCP.md` § 13.
- `NextIPRequest.strategy` → `sequential`, `random`, or `eui64`.
- Alias `record_type` → `CNAME` or `A`. Alias rows with no
  `name` are also rejected.

### CIDR form

- **Invalid CIDR notation.** Malformed CIDR strings are rejected.
- **CIDR with host bits set.** Non-strict CIDRs (e.g. `10.0.0.1/24`)
  are rejected with a message suggesting the normalised form
  (`10.0.0.0/24`).
- **Prefix length can't exceed the address family.** `/33+` for IPv4
  and `/129+` for IPv6 are rejected in the available-subnets query.
- **Available-subnets `prefix_len` must be strictly smaller than the
  block.** Asking for a `/24` inside a `/24` returns `422` — there's
  nothing to divide.

### Import / DNS linkage

- **IPAM import payload shape.** `POST /import/...` rejects requests
  without a top-level `payload` object. `422` in
  `backend/app/api/v1/ipam/io_router.py`.
- **DNS zone link must resolve.** Setting `dns_zone_id` on a subnet
  requires the zone to exist *in the subnet's configured view* —
  linking a zone from a different view returns `404`.
