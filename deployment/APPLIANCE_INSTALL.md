title: Install the OS Appliance
description: Step-by-step install of the SpatiumDDI OS appliance — get the ISO, walk the installer, first boot, first login, and add DNS / DHCP nodes.

# Install the OS Appliance

The appliance is the quickest way to a working SpatiumDDI: boot one ISO,
answer the installer's questions, and the full stack is serving on HTTPS a
few minutes after the reboot. It is a self-contained Debian 13 image with
[k3s](https://k3s.io/) embedded, so the same containers that ship as a Helm
chart run here as pods — but you never have to touch Kubernetes. The
installer, the **Appliance** section of the web UI and the console cockpit
hide it completely; there is no `kubectl` or `docker` to learn.

This page is the walkthrough. The design — why k3s, the A/B slot layout,
the fleet firewall, control-plane HA internals — lives in
[APPLIANCE.md](APPLIANCE.md). Prefer containers you manage yourself? See
[Docker Compose](DOCKER.md) or [Kubernetes](KUBERNETES.md) instead.

> **Beta.** The appliance is stable enough for labs, homelabs and pilots in
> front of non-critical client populations. Pin to a tested release for
> anything business-critical, and snapshot the VM before an OS upgrade.

## Before you begin

**A machine to install onto** — a VM under Proxmox, VMware, Hyper-V, QEMU or
UTM, or a bare-metal box. Size it for the role you will pick in the wizard:

| Role | vCPU | RAM | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|
| **First node** (control plane: api, web UI, worker, PostgreSQL, Redis, k3s) | 4 | 8 GiB | 40 GiB SSD |
| **Additional node** (DNS / DHCP agent, promotable to the control plane later) | 2 | 4 GiB | 32 GiB SSD |

The installer **refuses any disk under 32 GiB** — the A/B upgrade layout
needs two 8 GiB OS slots plus a `/var` that holds the image store, the
database and the logs. Below the recommended figures on a first node it
warns and lets you continue. SSD is strongly preferred; etcd and PostgreSQL
both live on the write path.

**Firmware.** The x86-64 image boots under BIOS or UEFI. The arm64 image is
UEFI-only, because AArch64 has no legacy boot path — the installer refuses
on a non-EFI arm64 machine rather than completing an install that could
never boot.

**Network.** DHCP is fine for an evaluation; for anything longer-lived have
a static address, prefix, gateway and resolver ready. If this node will
*serve* DHCP, its clients reach it by broadcast, so it needs a leg on their
layer-2 segment or an IP helper / relay on the router.

**A console.** The hypervisor console or a serial line — an 80×24 serial
console is a first-class install path. **Nothing is downloaded** during the
install or the first boot: the container images are baked into the ISO, so
an air-gapped install works. The one thing the appliance does want is a
reachable time source; a clock nothing corrects breaks TLS and pairing.

---

## 1. Get the ISO

Download the image for your architecture from the
[latest release](https://github.com/spatiumnorth/spatiumddi/releases/latest):

| Architecture | Asset | Firmware |
|---|---|---|
| x86-64 (Intel / AMD) | `spatiumddi-appliance-<version>-amd64.iso` | BIOS or UEFI |
| arm64 (Apple Silicon, Graviton, Ampere) | `spatiumddi-appliance-<version>-arm64.iso` | UEFI only |

Both are also published under un-versioned names that always point at the
current release:

```
https://github.com/spatiumnorth/spatiumddi/releases/latest/download/spatiumddi-appliance-amd64.iso
https://github.com/spatiumnorth/spatiumddi/releases/latest/download/spatiumddi-appliance-arm64.iso
```

Every night that `main` moves, a `nightly-YYYY.MM.DD` pre-release ships the
same artifacts, kept for seven days — useful for trying a fix before it is
tagged, never for production. To build the ISO yourself, `make
appliance-dev-iso` produces one in `appliance/build/`; see
[APPLIANCE.md](APPLIANCE.md#3-appliance-build-process) for prerequisites.

---

## 2. Run the installer

Attach the ISO as a CD-ROM in the hypervisor, or write it to a USB stick
with `dd` for bare metal, and boot from it. The wizard runs on the console.
Every screen has a **Back** button, and the final **Confirm** screen is a
menu of every answer, so a typo on screen three is fixed from the end rather
than by walking back through the wizard.

The screens, in order:

1. **Welcome** — lists what you will be asked. *Cancel* drops to a shell.
2. **Pre-flight** — everything the installer can learn before asking you
   anything: CPU and RAM, firmware mode, disks, which NICs have a link, the
   gateway and resolver, and whether the clock is sane. Informational only;
   the one hard gate in the wizard is the disk floor.
3. **Keyboard layout** — applied immediately, before the password screens,
   so the symbols in a good password land where you expect them.
4. **What is this node?** — the decision that shapes the rest:
   - **First node** creates a *new* SpatiumDDI: the control plane and the
     k3s seed. Pick this for a homelab, a single box, or the seed of a
     brand-new HA cluster. It asks you to confirm, because a second "first
     node" is a second, separate SpatiumDDI — not a cluster member.
   - **Additional node** (the default) joins an *existing* install. It runs
     DNS and DHCP roles an admin assigns from the Fleet UI, and can later
     be promoted into the control-plane cluster — this is how you add
     control-plane nodes for HA, never by installing "First node" again.
     It asks two more questions: the **control plane URL**, which the
     installer probes before the disk is touched (a typo landing on some
     other web server is caught here, not after the reboot), and an 8-digit
     **pairing code** from **Appliance → Fleet → Pairing codes** on the
     control plane. If the control plane is, or will become, an HA cluster,
     give the **control-plane VIP**, not a single node's address.
5. **Target disk** — pick from the disks that clear the 32 GiB floor. Each
   path of a multipath SAN LUN is refused rather than offered as a separate
   disk. With two disks of similar size you can **mirror the OS** (RAID1)
   across both. If the disk already holds a SpatiumDDI install, the
   installer offers a **reinstall** that keeps `/var` — the database, images
   and logs — and replaces only the OS slots.
6. **Confirm partition layout** — the exact GPT layout it is about to
   write, behind a checkbox. This is the last screen before the wipe that
   does not have *Install* as an option.
7. **Hostname.**
8. **Admin OS user + password** — your SSH account, with `sudo`. At least
   eight characters, not the username or hostname; anything weaker than
   that advises rather than refuses. The root account is **locked** unless
   you tick the box to keep it; `sudo -i` still works either way.
9. **SSH public key** — optional. Paste one, fetch from a URL, or give a
   bare GitHub username (fetched from `github.com/<user>.keys`, and only
   because you asked). With a key in place you can turn password SSH off.
10. **Network** — DHCP, or a static IPv4 address with optional static IPv6
    (a link-local gateway is accepted; that is how routers advertise
    themselves). On a multi-NIC box the interface picker shows which port
    has a cable in it and pins the one you choose.
11. **Timezone.**
12. **Time source** — NTP servers, pre-filled from what the DHCP lease
    offered. On a network with no route to the public pool, put your own
    server here. Leaving it blank means *no* time source at all — the
    Debian default pool is disabled too, not silently kept.
13. **k3s networking** *(first node only)* — the pod and service ranges,
    `10.42.0.0/16` and `10.43.0.0/16` by default. Press Enter through both
    unless your LAN already uses one of those ranges; the installer checks
    for an overlap with the address it just configured. These cannot be
    changed later without a reinstall.
14. **Review and Confirm** — every answer on one screen, then a menu of
    fields with *Install* deliberately last. Pick a field to change it, or
    *Install* to begin.

The install itself takes a few minutes with a progress bar. The **Done**
screen then shows where the web UI will be and asks you to **remove the
install media before the reboot** — an eject is sent, but a VM with the ISO
still attached boots straight back into the installer.

---

## 3. First boot

First boot takes **2–5 minutes**: it generates secrets, mints a self-signed
certificate, starts k3s and imports the baked container images. The console
shows the cockpit — a status ribbon, live vitals, pod health and the web UI
address — and until the API is serving, the web UI answers every page with
an auto-refreshing *"SpatiumDDI is initialising"* screen rather than errors.

An **additional node** has no web UI of its own. It registers with the
control plane on first boot and waits as *pending* until an admin approves
it; its console shows a **Pairing** row that goes green once registered.

---

## 4. Sign in

Browse to `https://<appliance-ip>/` — `:80` redirects. Accept the
self-signed certificate once; it is the same one the installer minted, and
it does not change under you mid-boot. Sign in as `admin` / `admin` and set
a real password when prompted.

Two things worth doing straight away:

- **Replace the certificate** under **Appliance → Web UI Certificate** —
  paste a PEM and key, generate a CSR on the server, or issue one from
  Let's Encrypt with the built-in ACME client. The web tier reloads on its
  own.
- **Set the external URL** and the other platform settings — step 1 of
  [Getting Started](../GETTING_STARTED.md#1-platform-settings-first-login),
  which then walks the setup order: server groups → zones and scopes →
  subnets → addresses.

On a single box, DNS and DHCP are **off** after install. Turn them on for
this node from **Appliance → Fleet**: open the node, pick a DNS engine
(`dns-bind9` / `dns-powerdns` / `dns-technitium` — one per node) and / or
`dhcp`, and the role pod is running in about 30 seconds.

---

## 5. Add DNS / DHCP nodes

For a distributed layout — control plane in one place, DNS and DHCP where
the clients are — install **Additional node** on each service box:

1. On the control plane, open **Appliance → Fleet → Pairing codes** and
   create a code. A single-use code expires in 15 minutes by default; a
   persistent code can be claimed several times, for fleet installs.
2. In the installer on the new box, pick **Additional node** and enter the
   control plane URL and the code.
3. After its first boot the node appears in **Appliance → Fleet** as
   *pending*. **Approve** it — this signs the node's certificate — then
   assign its roles and server groups. The pod schedules within ~30 s.

The agents cache their last-known-good configuration on disk and keep
serving if the control plane is unreachable, so a control-plane restart is
not a DNS or DHCP outage.

---

## 6. Grow to a high-availability control plane

A single first node is a one-node control plane. To survive a node loss,
install more **Additional nodes**, then promote them from **Appliance →
Fleet → Manage control plane cluster…**. Membership grows 1 → 3 → 5 → 7 —
embedded etcd wants an odd count, and the API refuses a batch that would
land on an even one. Promotion is hands-off: PostgreSQL grows to a primary
with streaming replicas, Redis switches to Sentinel, and the api, worker and
web tier spread one replica per node. Give the cluster one stable address by
setting a MetalLB pool and a **control-plane VIP** under **Appliance →
Network & Host**, and point every agent at that VIP.

See [APPLIANCE.md](APPLIANCE.md#control-plane-high-availability-272) for how
a promotion settles and [TOPOLOGIES.md](TOPOLOGIES.md) for the reference
layouts.

---

## Upgrades

Every appliance has two identical OS slots. An upgrade writes the new image
into the inactive slot, reboots into it, and reverts automatically if the
health check fails — the worst case is one wasted reboot. Schedule it per
node from **Appliance → Fleet**, or roll a whole cluster one node at a time
from **Rolling Upgrade**. Air-gapped sites mirror the slot image from
**Upgrade images** instead of fetching it from GitHub.

---

## If something goes wrong

- **It booted back into the installer.** The install media is still
  attached. Detach it (Proxmox: *Hardware → CD/DVD → Do not use*) and
  reboot.
- **The web UI never appears.** Give it five minutes on the first boot.
  Then, on the console, `F3` lists the pods; or SSH in as the admin user
  and run `kubectl get pods -A` — `kubectl` is on the PATH. The first-boot
  log is `journalctl -u spatiumddi-firstboot`.
- **The install failed.** The installer's logs survive the reboot at
  `/var/log/spatiumddi/install/`, and the answers you gave are at
  `/var/lib/spatium-state/spatium-preseed.yaml` (secrets omitted) — that
  file is a valid starting point for an unattended reinstall.
- **Something else.** [Troubleshooting](../TROUBLESHOOTING.md) has the
  recovery recipes, and **Admin → Support bundle** produces a scrubbed
  diagnostics archive for a bug report.

---

## Unattended installs

The wizard's answers can be supplied as a YAML answer file — on the kernel
command line as a URL, on the ISO, or as a cloud-init `CIDATA` volume — and
the installer runs without a console. `spatium-install --check-preseed
<file>` lints an answer file on any machine before you commit a box to it.
